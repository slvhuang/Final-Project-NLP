{"id":1,"cleaned text":"Children With Autism Saw Their Learning and Social Skills Boosted After Playing With This AI Robot admin  Latest posts by admin see all  Mansplaining in conferences: How can we get him to forestall  February 27, 2020 Coronavirus Could Explode in the U.S. Overnight Like it Did in Italy  February 27, 2020 Levi Strauss marks the next phase in corporate paid leave policies  February 27, 2020 Scientists who designed an artificially clever robotic that helped youngsters with autism spice up their studying and social talents hope such era may just in the future help others with the developmental dysfunction. The learn about noticed seven youngsters with gentle to average autism take domestic whats referred to as a socially assistive robotic, named Kiwi, for a month. According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between 3 and seven years previous, and performed spacethemed video games with the robotic virtually day by day. As Kiwi was once fitted with machinelearning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly. The authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some 92  had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary. Cameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to additionally observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from 48 to 84  on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with 90  accuracy. That was once in spite of possible distractions akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute. Lead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on.  Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the intervention setting. This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for realtime recognition and response to disengagement in order to reengage the child to continue with the educational andor therapeutic activity, he stated. From left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with coauthors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Mataris interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic. Around one in 59 youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction ASD, can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as neurotypical other folks. While therapists may give individualized products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots. Coauthor Maja Matari Maja J Matari, outstanding professor of pc science, neuroscience, and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek: We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR socially assistive robotics for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past 15 years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and nonthreatening. Jain stated: Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to autonomously acknowledge and reply to human conduct, particularly in ordinary customers and realworld settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI humanrobot interaction capacity in the past unexplored within the context of longterm, inhome SAR interventions for youngsters with ASD. Therefore this learn about is the primary to use mechanical device studying modeling to longterm inhome knowledge with youngsters with ASD.  Asked why the kidss engagement and studying stepped forward after interacting with the robotic, Matari stated: The objective of a socially assistive robotic, usually, is to serve within the function of a motivating and supportive spouse. In the particular context of this learn about, the robotic served to inspire the kids to do the maths workouts, and to make stronger them as they had been succeeding or failing throughout the ones workouts. However, youngsters with autism do not want robots to harvest the advantages noticed within the learn about, Matari stated. The maximum healing results come from being concerned human interactions, Matari explained. Parents, siblings, caregivers and buddies can successfully inspire and make stronger studying and remedy of kids with ASD by way of paying cautious consideration to what youngsters to find rewarding and encouraging, and specializing in the ones interactions, shaping towards the kids particular wishes.

{"id":2,"cleaned text":"Forget ML, AI and Industry 4.0  obsolescence should be your focus The world entered a new era of accelerated transformation in the last eighteen months that will continue to evolve and press forward for years to come. Most businesses are playing catchup trying to make sense of a new timeline where the ten years that had been set aside for careful planning and implementation of what was coming up next no longer exists. The next is happening now and, regardless of your industry or seniority, the status quo has shifted and you better face it. Back in 2019, I was invited to attend a pompous meeting in London at the Brazilian Embassy along with selected leading names from the oil and energy industry, to get an update on what was going to happen in the following decade. I could soon spot all the buzzwords coming up on PowerPoint slides from the different companies presenting: decommissioning, decarbonisation, zero emissions, transition to green energy. Throughout the morning and most of the afternoon, we heard that most of these changes would kick in between 203035. And I recall a Shell executive pointing out that the business had explicitly concluded that the current income streams were needed to provide the capital required for the transition to take place in due course.Whomever you talk to in the energy industry in 2021 would tell you to forget about that timeline. Change has come and the transition is happening much faster than anticipated, with big businesses scrambling to find the capital to fund all that is required. I could go on all day talking about how the pandemic and the impact it had on market demand and consumer behaviour messed up the timeline of transport, automotive, defence, manufacturing and so on. For instance, carrier planes that were due to be retired in 2017 are now required to remain in service at least until 2029. Projects in wind power involving upgrades of wind farms have been scrapped and new installations have drawn huge competition from up and coming brands with operators tending to favour smaller turbines  for being efficient and cheaper to run  and choosing to buy from multiple suppliers instead of just one company. Machine learning ML, AI and Industry 4.0 knock at the door. Still, the biggest change yet to be fully appreciated by business leaders is how electronics effectively became the brain of every industrial asset and all infrastructure equipment in operation in recent years, and therefore what is required to deal with breakdowns and obsolescence. For instance, I lost count of the many rail connections that I have working in operations and maintenance who struggle with their CME  chief mechanical engineer  who, like the role suggests, is usually a mechanicallybiased individual who may have a less than ideal approach when it comes to the handling of electronic failures. And you guessed right: less ideal means neither green nor cheap solutions, as illustrated in this video: www.dataweek.co.zamar21abi Many decisionmakers only realise the problem at hand and regret not following the tag RepairDontWaste on LinkedIn in times like this, resulting in comments like, We did not anticipate that the equipment would become obsolete so quickly or, Spare circuit boards started to take weeks then months to arrive. Then we were told that they would no longer be supplied. We were quoted sevenfigure prices to upgrade our assembly line.By deferring the responsibility to the original equipment supplier and other third parties, you are bound to be caught off guard soon or later. And the risk exposure from insisting on this strategy is about to get exponentially higher there is a widespread component shortage increasing lead times, and technology providers are dropping support for many products in order to remain viable.Last month, a wind turbine multinational in the US had to ship a bunch of expensive controller cards used in inverters and speed governing systems to its workshop in Brazil for repair as new replacement cards are not due back in stock for another six months. Good job that the local team had an electronic diagnostic equipment BoardMaster from ABI in the shop, ready to help the technicians locate the fault and repair the cards, which happened in record time.Poor decisionmaking when it comes to setting maintenance and repair strategies are often linked to fake news and myths such as: A repaired electronic card PCBPCBA will never be as good as a new one. The manufacturer told us that special software was required to troubleshoot the card. Troubleshooting down to the component level is impossible or would take too long. Dedicated test and repair equipment is prohibitively expensive.The mentality here needs to change, and fast. The longer you take to embrace the new strategies for inhouse fault analysis, maintenance, and obsolescence planning of your key electronic circuits and assets, the more expensive it will get to keep them going. Hundreds of leading organisations have found in recent years that the belief in these myths was hindering their results and compromising the operation  from GE Renewable to Collins Aerospace, where the latter reduced troubleshooting times on avionics circuit cards from 50 hours to 10 minutes. Then there is Lego in Mexico, where controller cards from 600 plastic moulding machines worth tens of thousands of dollars each have been mapped and are now repaired inhouse. In the US, an army engineer saved a mobile shelter unit worth 10 million dollars from being decommissioned by repairing its HVAC circuit board that was deemed irreparable by the OEM. In the rail arena, companies like Alstom, CAF, Bombardier and operators like Irish Rail, SFMTA, TCDD and so many others have discovered the benefits of investing in the right tool and skill development programme to shield the business against parts shortages and accelerated obsolescence. Some of their stories, and the technology that is driving several topshelf global sustainability projects, were the subject of a YouTube series called ABI Labs. The series gives an indepth review of the key tests and techniques available in the Britishmade BoardMaster hardware and software platform from ABI Electronics to handle predictive as well as corrective maintenance of critical electronics without wasting time or money.

{"id":13,"cleaned text":"Apple bought more AI companies than anyone else between 2016 and 2020 Once in a while, Apple announces the acquisition of another company or startup, but now, new research from GlobalData shows that Apple is in fact investing heavily in artificial intelligence. The research reveals that Apple has acquired more AI companies than anyone else between 2016 and 2020. Apple comes ahead of companies like Accenture, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook when it comes to the acquisition of companies and startups that specialize in AI. In five years, Apple has bought 25 AI companies, while Google has bought 14. When considering the data from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook combined, more than 60 of AI companies were acquired between 2016 and 2020. AI has remained a key focus area for tech giants and growing competition to dominate the space has resulted in an acquisition spree among these companies, said GlobalData. With the advances in technologies that rely on artificial intelligence, ranging from virtual assistants to neural engines, its expected that these big tech companies would invest in such category. As for Apple, most of the acquisitions seem to be related to improving Siri, as noted by Nicklas Nilsson, Senior Analyst on the Thematic Research Team at GlobalData. Apple has gone on a shopping spree in efforts to catch up with Google Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Siri was first on the market, but it consistently ranks below the two in terms of smartness, which is partly why Apple is far behind in smart speaker sales. Apple also want to make sure to keep its strong position within wearables. It is the dominant player in smartwatches. The acquisition of Xnor.ai last year was made to improve its onedge processing capabilities, which has become important as it eliminates the need for data to be sent to the cloud, thereby improving data privacy. Of course, there are investments in other areas as well. Lighthouse AI, a home security camera startup, was acquired by Apple in 2019, while Drive.ai, also acquired in 2019, had multiple technologies related to autonomous vehicles. As always, Apple doesnt detail the purpose of each acquisition. Youre reading 9to5Mac  experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

There  exists  several  generalisations  of  differential  cryptanalysis and  it  is  also  used  in  combination  with  other  cryptanalysis  techniques  to  improve  the  attack  complexity.  Usefulness  of  Machine  learning  in  differential  cryptanalysis  is  introduced  by  Gohr  in 2019  to  attack  the  lightweight  block  cipher  SPECK.  In  this  paper,  we  present  a  framework  to  combine  the  classical  differential  distinguisher and  machine  learning ML  based  differential  distinguisher.  We  propose  a  novel  technique  to  construct  differentialML  distinguisher  which  provides  better  results  with  reduced  data  complexity.  This  technique  is  demonstrated  on  lightweight  block  ciphers  SPECK   SIMON  where 96  99 or  more  success  rate  is  achieved  for  distinguishing  the 6round  SPECK Category  Keywords: foundations  Block Cipher, Differential Cryptanalysis, Machine Learning Post collegatiEPRINT REPORT: DIFFERENTIALML DISTINGUISHER: MACHINE LEARNING BASED GENERIC EXTENSION FOR DIFFERENTIAL CRYPTANALYSISRedazione23 Luglio 2020EPRINT REPORT: DOES FIATSHAMIR REQUIRE A CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTIONRedazione23 Luglio 2020EPRINT REPORT: ULTRASHORT MULTIVARIATE PUBLIC KEY SIGNATURESRedazione23 Luglio 2020EPRINT REPORT: A POWER SIDECHANNEL ATTACK ON THE CCA2SECURE HQC KEMRedazione23 Luglio 2020EPRINT REPORT: MAGNIFYING SIDECHANNEL LEAKAGE OF LATTICEBASED CRYPTOSYSTEMS WITH CHOSEN CIPHERTEXTS: THE CASE STUDY OF KYBERRedazione23 Luglio 2020EPRINT REPORT: LOSSY CORRELATION INTRACTABILITY AND PPAD HARDNESS FROM SUBEXPONENTIAL LWERedazione23 Luglio 2020 Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. @2019  agenparl.eu.

KOTARO FUKUOKA, TAKURO KUSASHIO and YAOYU ZHANG, Nikkei staff writersJuly 25, 2021 11:00 JST  EuropeCopyCopiedTOKYO  Artificial intelligence is transforming the landscape of drug discovery and development. The technology is helping to slash the time and money needed to develop new drugs for COVID19 and other serious diseases by quickly identifying promising drug candidates.In the case of COVID19, the application of AI helped one company come up with a treatment that was approved in the U.S. in a lightningfast nine months.British AI startup BenevolentAI identified baricitinib, a drug developed by Elli Lily for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as a potentially effective COVID19 drug in just a few days. The medication has been approved as a COVID19 treatment in the U.S. and Japan. The European Medicines Agency has also begun evaluating baricitinib for use against the coronavirus.A BenevolentAI specialist team was tasked with using the companys stateoftheart AI to find an already approved drug that could be repurposed as a COVID19 treatment. This approach made it possible to win emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat hospitalized COVID19 patients in just nine months, instead of the several years typically required. Drug discovery usually involves a long search for candidates and animal testing to evaluate their safety.BenevolentAIs technology identifies potential drug candidates using data from clinical trials, academic papers, and its own database on diseases, genes and pharmaceuticals. When a target protein is identified, AI finds candidate drugs that act on it.Applying AI to drug discovery and development is expected to sharply reduce in the time required to create new drugs, a process that usually takes nine to 17 years. That time could be cut in half for approved drugs that are repurposed for other uses.In February 2020, soon after the World Health Organization declared the COVID19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, BenevolentAIs first paper on baricitinib as a candidate COVID19 treatment, published in the British medical journal The Lancet, found that the drug may inhibit the ability of the virus to infect lung cells and cause inflammation in patients.Eli Lilly, which owns the rights to baricitinib, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a study in the U.S. to examine the efficacy and safety of the drug as a potential treatment for hospitalized COVID19 patients. Because the study found that baricitinib can shorten recovery times and improve clinical outcomes for patients, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the drug in November last year. The drug has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalized patients by 38 when used in combination with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, according to data released by Eli Lilly.BenevolentAI is also developing drugs on its own, focusing on treatments for more than 10 diseases, including atopic dermatitis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS, also known as motor neurone disease or Lou Gehrigs disease.The company started a clinical trial on a potential treatment for atopic dermatitis in February. It is also working with AstraZeneca to develop a treatment for chronic kidney disease.Use of AI in drug discovery and development is spreading around the world. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, in partnership with Exscientia, an Oxford, Englandbased AI drug discovery startup, has found a candidate treatment for obsessivecompulsive disorder. Last year, the Japanese drugmaker began clinical trials of the drug candidate in Japan to evaluate its safety.We found the candidate in less than a year using AI for the process, which typically takes four and a half years, said an executive at Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma. In May, the company started Phase 1 clinical trials in the U.S. on an Alzheimers disease psychosis drug candidate designed using Exscientias AI technology.AI does not do all the work. It is used to find candidate drugs and narrow down the design of new drugs by crunching huge amounts of data from scientific papers and experiments. People must work out which direction to take the research and development itself.Exscientia is attracting the attention of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies around the world. Evotec, a German biomedical company, has jointly developed a new cancer treatment with Exscientia. Human clinical trials of the A2a receptor antagonist began in April, according to Evotec. The candidate drug was discovered eight months after the two companies launched the project.Taisho Pharmaceutical of Japan and Insilico Medicine, a Hong Kongbased AI startup, started a joint research project last fall to identify therapeutic compounds that may slow the cellular effects of aging. Insilico is using its AI networks to identify therapeutic targets and find druglike molecules that target senescent cells. The accumulation of these cells as people age is thought to be behind a variety of diseases.Insilicos job is to identify the role senescence plays in specific cells, tissues and diseases, with different proteins implicated for each, and to design molecules to tackle those targets. Taisho will validate the computergenerated compounds through in vitro and in vivo testing.Some Japanese AI startups are playing catchup with such overseas leaders in the field. Hacarus, a Kyotobased AI startup, and the University of Tokyo in June announced the start of a joint research project to develop cures for Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. Both are caused by the accumulation of certain proteins in the brain. Using AI to develop drugs for these types of disease is still rare.The project is aimed at creating a system in one year to efficiently search for compounds that could be candidate drugs. The AIdriven approach will dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of the research process, which has traditionally depended on human hands and eyes, said Taisuke Tomita, a professor at the University of Tokyos Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences.More than 120 Japanese companies and universities have joined the Life Intelligence Consortium, an industryacademia collaboration aimed at applying AI to the life sciences. The consortium has already created around 20 prototype AI programs for drug discovery and development.AI will soon become an essential technology for drug discovery and development, said Yasushi Okuno, a Kyoto University professor. The technology offers the opportunity to reconsider the conventional wisdom that developing a new drug takes 10 years.Coming up with new has become hugely expensive. The average cost to develop a prescription drug that makes it to market soared to some 2.9 billion in the 2000s, up from 180 million in the 1970s, according to an estimate by Tufts University in the U.S. The rise in drug development costs has been far steeper than inflation overall.Many new drugs have been developed over years, especially treatments for cancers and lifestyle diseases. Many substances that act on important molecules implicated in the development of diseases have already been identified and developed into drugs. As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult to develop effective new drugs. And a greater emphasis on safety has stretched out the time needed for clinical trials.Only one in about 30,000 candidate substances actually becomes a new drug, according to the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. The process can take nine to 17 years. RD spending by pharmaceutical companies is equal to roughly 10 of annual sales, compared with around 4 for the manufacturing sector as a whole.In their efforts to come up with new treatments, drug companies are devoting more of their resources to the development of biopharmaceuticals  complex medicines made from living cells or organisms, often created using cuttingedge technologies, including antibody drug conjugates. Developing and manufacturing biopharmaceuticals is thus complicated and costly.One such drug, Nivolumab, is sold under the brand name Opdivo. It was first used in Japan in 2014 to treat a variety of cancers and initially cost some 35 million yen 318,000 a year to administer. This led to complaints that its use would further strain the governments already huge and growing health care spending.AI is among the technologies that could, by drastically shortening drug development time and cost, help to keep prices in check, thereby improving access to new treatments for previously intractable diseases and enhancing the quality of life for everyone.Stay ahead with our exclusives on AsiaSign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox.CopyCopiedRead NextHealth CareFujifilm has title of Japans top medical device maker in focusPharmaceuticalsShionogi to leverage Ping An health care data to speed growthStartupsIndian startup helps 300m patients find doctors onlineTechnologyJapanese companys AI to offer 5minute dementia diagnosisStartupsSingapore investors plow into health care startups StartupsChinese startup develops robot for dispensing medicineScienceAI and deep learning could help alleviate a doctor shortage in JapanSponsored Content This content was commissioned by Nikkeis Global Business Bureau.Discover the all new Nikkei Asia appGet Insights on Asia in your inboxSign UpConnect With UsDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia appConnect With UsAbout usContact usSitemapHelpTerms of useCopyrightPrivacy  cookie policy AdvertisingNikkei Inc.

{"id":30,"cleaned text":"Apple Acquires AI Voice Startup Voysis to Make Siri Better Understand Our Queries This seems to a week full of acquisitions for Apple. The company acquired wellknown weather app Dark Sky merely a couple of days ago. Now, Bloomberg reports that Apple has picked up AI voice startup Voysis that could help make Siri better at understanding the users natural language. Siri may be great at answering your basic questions, ranging from time and weather to the distance to the moon. But, it lags considerably behind the likes of Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. The latter two have taken a massive lead over other voice assistants in the market. But, Apple is now looking to play catch and make Siri more competent and intuitive to the users commands. And it seems like the company thinks that Dublinbased Voysis could be helpful in giving Siri that boost  the feature set required to compete with its rivals. In an official statement, the Apple spokesperson did not confirm the acquisition and simply said, Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans. The Voysis website is offline and its social handles have also been taken down, so theres no way for us to independently verify the acquisition. Voysis was founded by Noel Ruane and Peter Cahill around 8 years ago, back in 2012, to build a voicedriven natural language platform that businesses could integrate into their platforms. The company wanted to set itself apart from Assistant and Alexa by offering an accurate answer to queries like I want to buy an LED TV for 600 euros. Suggest me the best options, said Cahill in a 2017 interview. As for the technology behind Voysiss voicebased AI platform, the company taps into WaveNet, which is an AIdriven method for more natural humanlike speech synthesis. This technology was first developed by Googles Deepmind division back in 2016 and Voysis managed to shrink its system to the point where, once the AI is trained, the software uses as little as 25 megabytes of memory. This would have made running AI operations on the smartphone itself less of a chore. Theres still a couple of months to go for this years WWDC, so lets hang tight and see whether Apple announces new voices or features for Siri during its iOS 14 presentation at the onlineonly event.

{"id":31,"cleaned text":"  Amid ChatGPTs rise to fame, how can enterprises work to eliminate AI bias Amid ChatGPTs rise to fame, how can enterprises work to eliminate AI bias Artificial intelligence continues to hog the headlines, as more people discover the power of tools like OpenAIs DALLE 2 and especially ChatGPT. These futuristicseeming tools work by taking a humans query or prompt and returning an intelligent textual or visual response. From an enterprise perspective, AI adoption is growing rapidly. According to Forrester, spending on AI software is set to accelerate from 33 billion in 2021 to 64 billion in 2025  growing twice as fast as the overall software market. But while tools like ChatGPT may seem like magic, its important to understand these solutions arent perfect. In particular, enterprise leaders should grasp one of the most pressing concerns they raise: AI bias. Also known as algorithm bias, AI bias occurs when human biases make their way into algorithms. These biases can be preexisting when human programmers create algorithms, they may inadvertently or even deliberately select a limited range of input data, or input data from a biased source. AI bias can also arise due to the limitations of the particular algorithm being used.  AI bias isnt a minority concern, either. More than 50 percent of organizations are concerned by the potential for AI bias to hurt their business. But what exactly is the issue, and why should enterprises care Generally speaking, AI that produces offensive results can be attributed to the way the AI learns, and the dataset it is using. If the data overrepresents or underrepresents a particular population in a particular way, the AI will repeat that bias, generating even more data that further pollutes the data source and its own decisionmaking. Take the case of the Allegheny Family screening model, which helps decide whether a child should be removed from a family due to abuse. Here, the bias reflects a broader societal prejudice: the models training dataset only comprises publiclyavailable data meaning it overlooks families that can afford private care providers. Similarly, in healthcare, AI software for detecting melanoma appears less likely to work on people with darker skin as many of the datasets used to train this software use images from Europe, North America, and Oceania exclusively. In a British context, a UK governmentbacked study published in the British Medical Journal in 2022 found that AI models built to identify those people at high risk of liver disease from blood tests are twice as likely to miss disease in women as in men. And finally, a 2019 UC Berkeley study found that AI used to allocate patient care assigned black patients lower risk scores than white patients, despite the fact that the black patients were statistically more likely to have comorbid conditions, and so in fact experience higher levels of risk. As a result of these inequities, companies could risk serious reputational damage. Indeed, one recent survey of UK and US IT chiefs found 36 percent of businesses have been negatively impacted by AI bias, resulting in lost revenue and customers. The same survey found a loss of customer trust is viewed as the main risk arising from AI bias, with over half 56 percent of executives citing it. While some believe ChatGPT has the potential to weaken Googles dominance of the searchengine space  or even to usurp Google altogether  cases like the Berkeley study call this into question. Indeed, Googles AI chief Jeff Dean has dismissed ChatGPTs potential threat along these lines, pointing to widespread, preexisting trust in the integrity of Googles search results. Eliminating the biases present in human judgements is a daunting task, and as social scientists have suggested, bias may be an inevitable feature of human brains. Thankfully bias in data sets can be reduced and mitigated. Data scientists must be trained to better curate the data they use, and to ensure ethical practices are followed in collecting and cleansing this data. They should also strive to preserve and promote highquality data. As for the underrepresentation of particular groups, the best solution here is transparency. By ensuring data is open and available to as many data scientists as possible, we can ensure more diverse groups of people can sample the data and point out inherent biases. Using these experiences, we can also build AI models that will train the trainer, so to speak, when it comes to identifying biased data. Taking this a step further, it would also be helpful to remove other data which is correlated with protected information, such as postcodes, which could be used to exclude certain demographics. AI bias can have grave consequences for enterprises, and as weve seen those consequences can easily spill over into wider society. Whether the consequences are a general mistrust of AI poor business decisions or decisions that harm the welfare of whole communities, all of society must come together to solve AI bias. Its incumbent on data scientists, enterprise leaders, academics and governmental agencies to work together: sharing data freely and openly to arrive at a point where we can place greater trust in AI. Quite simply, AI bias is too complicated and too important an issue to be tackled any other way.

{"id":54,"cleaned text":"Assume it, an artificial intelligence is going to win the game   Babelia The digital recreation of CarrieAnne Moss and Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Awakens. In 1996, Gari Kasparov, world chess champion, was seduced by an idea that went around the globe: compete against the IBM Deep Blue computer.  Although he lost a game out of six, the human champion managed to prevail over the digital beast.  However, in 1997 and with the improved Deep Blue, the Russian grandmaster lost what was announced as the most spectacular chess duel in history, the final battle for the brain and other very measured epitomes.  The machine, for the first time, had won over man.  I was furious.  Not because I lost for the first time against a machine, but because it was the first time I lost, in general, Kasparov now recalls in a recent short documentary on the interactive card game. Heartstone, in which the Russian faces an artificial intelligence again.  And lose again. Since that defeat that marked a quarter of a century in February, artificial intelligence has grown by leaps and bounds in the world of technology.  In video games, the nonhuman enemies we face have mercilessly evolved developing their own internal logics.  In 2015, Google reissued IBMs feat and its AlphaGo defeated for the first time a champion of the millennial Go game, the FrenchChinese Fan Hui. These days two technological alerts have taken place.  The one who is perhaps the most important person in the world these months, the always great and sometimes disconcerting Elon Musk, left no doubt about what he thinks about it: Artificial intelligence will make jobs a bit useless, he said without blink the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX last Thursday in Shanghai, within the framework of the World Conference on Artificial Intelligence.  In case there was any doubt, he has reiterated in several tweets this month his interest in hiring expert engineers in the field, since he believes that it is the profession with the most future. In addition, with nocturnal and treachery and for free last Friday it appeared available, for Play Station 5 and Xbox The Matrix awakens, a demonstration of the capabilities of the Unreal 5 graphics engine based on the Wachowski sisters scifi universe.  It is only a brief car chase and a walk through a city full of vehicles and people, but you can listen to whoever writes this: it is the most indistinguishable from reality that has been done in video games.  The lighting, the physics of the cars, the textures of the city, the recreation of actors like Keanu Reeves and CarrieAnne Moss are simply astonishing.  Several comments from social network users could be summed up in a statement as daring as it is inescapable because it is seductive, because it is provocative in an article like this: The cinema cannot compete with this. We do not know if the cinema of action, it is understood will be able to compete with this.  What we do know is that Kasparovs documentary is cheating.  The champion loses the Heartstone 12 but, engrossed in the games of his tablet, What he does not know is that who he is really playing with is Slyssa, former world number two of the aforementioned game.  After the fight and revealed the trap, both greet each other and show mutual admiration.  It is very possible that artificial intelligence will end up imposing and making Musks prophecy come true, but today those who tighten the nuts are still people.  Those who program the machines are still human.  The software, for now, you cannot write your own software. We also know something else: that since the gambling bug bit him he tells it, Kasparov plays almost daily Heartstone and hes slowly climbing the world rankings.  As long as we continue to learn, as long as we are willing to continue learning, we will be fine, the Russian left as an optimistic corollary.  If a new fight between apocalyptics and integrated is looming, it seems that Kasparov has already chosen sides.

{"id":75,"cleaned text":"How does artificial intelligence work, and how is it disrupting the tech industry Key Takeaways The power of AI is evident in our daily lives, from what we log into social media and what we see on streaming services. We take a look at how AI works and why it has such a disruptive impact on the IT industry. With new products in this space rapidly changing the tech industry, Google recently had to issue a code red when ChatGPT was released. Large companies like Alphabet struggle to decide how to compete with smaller startups like OpenAI for new public releases of their innovative products. Artificial intelligence has been getting a lot of attention lately as new tools have become available to the public that can create art and content from text prompts. The pace of AIrelated innovation appears to be accelerating as new tools emerge faster than ever. The entire tech industry is on the fence, and every innovation has the potential to bring new disruptions to current ways of doing things. Learn how artificial intelligence works, how it can revolutionize the tech industry, and how to start investing in AI. At its most superficial level, AI is the use of computer systems to handle tasks that humans have typically performed throughout history. These tasks include creating art and content, making decisions, translating languages, handling customer service issues, submitting insurance claims, providing recommendations, and more. The field of AI has improved a lot recently as modern tools can now create graphics and longform content from simple text prompts. We recently wrote about ChatGPT and DALLE 2. These two groundbreaking products were revolutionary in the field of AI and seemed to come out of nowhere to those new to the field. While these new tools have taken the world by storm, AI has been quietly working in our daily lives for years. Here are some examples:  Netflix uses AI to suggest movies and content to users, increasing customer retention. Google Maps helps you reach your destination in the most efficient way. When you contact a help desk on a website, you are probably talking to a machine. Search engines use AI to determine what kind of content is best served based on what users are looking for. Amazons Alexa devices, which many of us have in our living rooms, use conversational AI, and the Amazon.com website uses them to recommend products when shopping. Social media companies use AI to determine what kind of content you see when you log on. How is AI disrupting the tech industry AI has impacted nearly every industry possible, but theres no denying the huge impact of machine learning in tech, where weve seen a lot of job cuts and changes lately. Here are some examples of how AI is disrupting the tech industry. AIpowered tools are accelerating rapidly, with new software emerging to make certain tasks even easier. Weve talked extensively about generative AI that allows you to create desired art and content simply by entering text prompts. With these tools alone, machines can now write articles, create content, and generate graphics for social media, many are concerned about future layoffs. During the months of the pandemic, we kept hearing about blockchain and how this gamechanging technology is the future. Information is coming out. Weve also seen headlines about Microsoft investing his 10 billion in OpenAI, which is a staggering figure considering the tech giant laid off about 10,000 employees in the same period. More funding for the power of AI means that other areas of the tech industry get less attention. When testing ChatGPT, many commented that the tool could be more powerful than a search engine. When you use Google to search for something, you have to filter through a large number of search results, ads, and random websites to find a solution. As a result of these disruptive AI tools, Google has to understand how to proceed as its search engine business could end up being a strong competitor, so its making Code Red. Announced. Google is hesitant to release a similar chatbot due to reputational risk as the tool is not yet fully mature. Google also relies heavily on advertising revenue to run its business, and there are concerns that tools like ChatGPT could one day replace traditional search engines. Following the response to ChatGPT, it is reported that Google plans to release about 20 new products in 2023, potentially adding similar functionality to its search engine. In the future, the business model of search engines and the way we search for information will change significantly with the power of AI. IBM has worked to develop customer service robots that sound like humans. Lemonade, an AIpowered insurance company, has a bot named Maya that handles everything from signing up a customer for a policy to submitting a claim, so there is absolutely no human interaction. The tech industry relies heavily on AI to handle customer service, and rumor has it that many companies will one day not even have humans to handle customer service inquiries. According to a recent report from Semafor, OpenAI has invested in training AI to perform engineering tasks so that it can replace software engineers. It turns out that an Amazon coder is using his ChatGPT to help with the work. It is clear that AI will impact how the tech industry addresses future staffing needs. Theres optimism that tech stocks could rebound from the disastrous year of 2022 to 2023 if the economy manages to avoid a recession. increase. What we do know for sure is that progress in this area continues to change the landscape. While editing this article, it became clear that Google had discovered a way to convert text to music. Further advances in AI will continue to disrupt the tech industry in new ways. AI is creating tools that can create art from text prompts and content from simple questions, but this space will require some form of governance. Theres a fine line between using AIpowered tools to help you do your job and blatant plagiarism taking credit for work you didnt do. There are also concerns that AI will take over jobs that humans have traditionally done. This means that AI will need governance as it becomes difficult to determine who has done the work. Many school districts are beginning to ban tools like ChatGPT out of concern that students will steal the work of bots. Clearly outlined government intervention may be required to better understand how to handle these new AIpowered tools. The field of AI has had a disruptive impact on the technology industry and many others, but the current macroeconomic environment cannot be ignored. Many of the worlds largest tech companies have seen significant market share losses in 2022 due to skyrocketing inflation, aggressive interest rate hikes and fears of a global recession. This makes it difficult to decide how to invest your money while trying to add his AI exposure to your portfolio. The good news is that Q.ai takes the guesswork out of investing when you dont want to interfere. Q.ai uses AI to provide an investment option for those who dont want to follow the stock market every day, so you dont need to look any further to see how AI really works. If youre a proponent of innovative technology, we recommend checking out the Emerging Tech Kit. As you can see, the field of AI is advancing rapidly and changing the way businesses operate. Whether we realize it or not, AI is also affecting our everyday environment. We have to pay attention to how much we rely on machine learning. That said, the broader macroeconomic environment has remained a difficult time for AIpowered tech companies. Continue to monitor AI advancements and their impact on all of us.

Its also the latest in a series of scandals in the financial and commoditiestrading hub, where assets under management have swelled to S4 trillion thanks largely to inflows from overseas.Much about Ng and his dealings remains shrouded in mystery. But open court proceedings, interviews with investors and charge sheets by Singapore prosecutors indicate the young financier was able to raise huge sums of money by touting average quarterly gains of 15  a track record that would have placed him in the same league as the worlds topperforming hedge fund managers.While Singapore offers plenty of legitimate business opportunities, there will likely be other instances of suspect behavior as money flows into the country and investors reach for returns in an era of historically low interest rates, according to Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking whos been working in the countrys finance industry for more than three decades.This wont be the last case and thats the sad reality, Song said.Attempts to reach Ng for comment via email were unsuccessful. His lawyer, Davinder Singh, executive chairman of Davinder Singh Chambers, didnt reply to emailed questions. Its unclear from charge sheets and court proceedings whether Ng has entered a plea. A citizen of Singapore, hes been released on S1.5 million bail and is subject to electronic monitoring. The court will hear further proceedings in coming weeks.While little is known about Ngs early life, he had become an increasingly visible figure in Singapores philanthropic, supercar and corporate communities in recent years.In August 2020, he won praise from the prestigious Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore for his contribution to a fundraising drive.A Pagani Huayra supercar was among S100 million of assets seized from Ng by the nations Commercial Affairs Department, the Straits Times reported, citing sources it didnt name. It is inappropriate to comment on ongoing police investigations, the Singapore police said when asked about the seizure.Industry sources have valued Ngs Pagani Huayra at between S7 million and S8 million, according to the Straits Times.Ngs business interests spanned everything from commodities trading and tech startups to Japanese restaurants and a veterinary clinic, according to corporate filings.The fraud allegations against Ng center on his dealings at Envy Asset Management and Envy Global Trading, companies he controlled and where he was a director. Of the more than S1 billion that was invested in the companies, S300 million was transferred to Ngs personal account while an estimated S200 million remains unaccounted for, prosecutors alleged in court proceedings last month.While investors received payments worth S700 million, theyre owed another S1 billion based on the face value of outstanding contracts, prosecutors said.Both Envy Asset and Envy Global are under investigation by Singapore police, according to a police statement, though only Ng has been charged. An external representative for Envy Global didnt respond to emails seeking comment. Envy Asset is no longer active, the representative of Envy Global said in February.Ngs purported investment strategies that are under the spotlight were linked to nickel, a key ingredient in many electriccar batteries. The metal has become a popular speculative bet in recent years amid soaring demand for Teslas and other EVs.In one transaction described in charge sheets, Ng was involved in raising money from investors claiming he would use it to buy nickel from an Australian company called Poseidon Nickel Ltd. He never followed through with the purchase, prosecutors said. Poseidons chief executive officer, Peter Harold, said in an email that the company has had no engagement with Ng or related entities.Ng was involved in deceiving investors into buying supposed forward contracts that were purportedly with French lender BNP Paribas SA, but those contracts didnt exist, according to the charge sheets. BNP had no account or trading history with Ng, Envy Asset Management or Envy Global Trading, a person familiar with the matter said. A BNP spokesperson declined to comment.One person who said he began investing with Ng in 2018 after hearing about him through business associates said he never withdrew money because he believed Ng was delivering sustained high returns.Documents seen by Bloomberg that were sent by Envy Asset Management to potential investors and partners include details such as purchase and sale prices of prior nickel transactions, contract durations and expected profits in percentages down to the fourth decimal point.Ngs investors included Envysion Wealth Management Pte., a Singaporean fund management company, and its founder Shim Wai Han. While Envysion has a similar name to those of Ngs companies and shared meeting rooms and pantry services with them through a rental agreement, Shim said in an April 1 interview and subsequent messages that Envysion is otherwise unrelated to Ng. He isnt an owner or executive at Envysion, she said.Prosecutors allege that Ng convinced Envysion and Shim to invest S48 million in receivables on nickel products that never existed.Our objective now is just one thing, Shim said in the interview. To get back the money for investors and for ourselves.The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the nations financial regulator, is conducting a supervisory review of Envysion to determine if there have been governance or risk management failures by its board and senior management. Envysion hasnt been accused of any wrongdoing, Shim said in the interview.Shim said she and Envysion are working on this together with MAS to help investors. She said she conducted due diligence into her investments with Ng, including by asking friends in the commodities industry to assess his trades and strategy. Other executives at Envysion also did due diligence on the investments with Ng, according to Shim.Both Envy Asset and Envy Global arent licensed by MAS, since the regulator doesnt require licenses from firms investing in physical assets for highnet worth investors or institutions. MAS put Envy Asset on its investor alert list last year to highlight that the firm may have been wrongly perceived as being licensed by MAS, according to a March statement from the monetary authority.Ng has been removed as managing director of Envy Global, the company said last month, adding that it established an independent interim management committee to meet obligations to clients in cooperation with authorities.For more, read: Singapore Corporate Scandals Spur Push for More TransparencyWhile Singapore is far from the only place grappling with instances of suspected fraud, large corporate scandals have made waves in the city in recent years  including the collapse of oil trading giant Hin Leong Trading Ltd. last year.Authorities have to strike a balance between ramping up reporting requirements to alleviate concerns about misbehavior and supporting the expansion of the financial centre, said Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School.

Adani Green Energy Ltd. and Adani Ports  Special Economic Zone Ltd. are already there.The potential inclusions are seen further boosting wealth for Adani, who has added 20.2 billion to his net worth this year, the secondbiggest increase among the worlds billionaires. The tycoon  who started out as a commodities trader in the late 1980s  has diversified from mines, ports and power plants into airports, data centers and defense. The rally in stocks shows investors have rewarded his strategy of interlocking his groups interests with the Indian governments infrastructure program.There is very high probability of these Adani names to come in the index primarily due to the surge in their market capitalization, Brian Freitas, a New Zealandbased analyst at Smartkarma, said by phone. ETFs and other passive funds will have to buy, adding to Adanis fortune.Passive funds may have to buy shares worth about 830 million in total in the three companies after their inclusion, according to calculations by Freitas. Still, these stocks trade much much higher than their global peers and longerterm returns may not be worth the risks involved, he wrote in a note Wednesday.Meanwhile, SP Dow Jones Indices said in a statement Monday that it will remove Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes because of links to Myanmar military.A lack of analyst coverage for many of the Adani groups companies hasnt deterred MSCI from adding their stocks as the index providers focus is more on other factors such as market value. Adani Green, which was added to the MSCI India gauge endNovember, still has no analysts covering it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Freitas also sees the possibility of Adani Green being included in the NSE Nifty 50 Index, the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.s benchmark gauge, once the bourse allows derivative contracts on the stock.Adani group shares traded mixed amid a broad decline in Indian equities on Thursday. Adani Transmission jumped 5, Adani Total Gas climbed 2.3 while Adani Ports rose 0.2 as of 10:28 a.m. in Mumbai. Adani Enterprises and Adani Green fell about 1.2 each.MSCI is set to declare the results of its latest review on May 11 and changes will be effective from close of trading on May 28, according to an announcement by the index provider in February.We do not comment on market speculation on index changes, a spokeswoman for MSCI wrote in an emailed response.Adds more details in the eighth paragraph, Thursdays share performance in the ninth.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P.10h agoBloombergBank Fines, Suspensions Weighed by Zimbabwe for Currency GougingBloomberg  Zimbabwe is considering penalizing domestic banks, telecommunications operators and other businesses over what the government describes as profiteering off the hard currency it makes available at auctions.Lenders could face fines and suspensions, while companies that charge a premium for foreign exchange may be banned from participating in the auctions, central bank Governor John Mangudya said in a phone interview from the capital, Harare.All the malpractices will be targeted, he said. Theres no need to chase foreign currency as if it will run out.President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Monday threatened unspecified actions against sharks in the financial sector, according to the stateowned Herald newspaper, which said unidentified entities are profiteering at the publics expense. The presidents comments were made during a wideranging interview he gave to stateowned television that will be aired on April 17 on the eve of Independence Day celebrations, the paper said.Exchange ClosedMnangagwa has previously issued warnings to private companies he blames for undermining his efforts to turn around an economy plagued by annual inflation of 241 and foreigncurrency shortages.Last year, his government closed the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange for five weeks and singled out the largest mobile operator, Econet Wireless Zimbabwe Ltd., for undermining the nations currency through its mobilemoney service. Econet denied the allegations.The impending action is an attempt to prevent manipulation of the foreigncurrency auction system, according to the Herald. The system has provided over 800 million to companies since its introduction in June, though high demand for U.S. dollars by importers means that there is only a limited supply.Monetary authorities met with the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe on April 12 to discuss due diligence and knowyourcustomer requirements in order to ensure economic stability, Mangudya said.Ralph Watungwa, president of the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe, didnt immediately answer two calls to his mobile phone seeking comment.Zimbabwe reintroduced its own currency in 2019 after a 10year hiatus and has been battling bouts of high inflation and shortages of everything from foreign currency to food. The local unit, which was pegged at parity to the U.S. dollar as recently as February 2019, has plunged to 84 per U.S. dollar.The gap between the official exchange rate and parallel market has widened by 36, with a U.S. dollar selling for 115 Zimbabwean dollars on the streets of Harare.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P.5h agoReutersPolicy hawks, courts will test ECB and euro debt marketsEuro zone politicians, courts and policy hawks will pose a stiff challenge this year to the ECBs resolve to pin down the blocs borrowing costs, precisely at a time when higher U.S. Treasury yields are tempting investors away from European markets.

Xinjiang already grows more than 80 of the countrys cotton, and some of those pig farms would replace fields sown to the fiber that have been degraded.The suggestion comes after the U.S. banned imports of textile products containing cotton from Xinjiang in protest over alleged illtreatment of its ethnic Uighur Muslim minority, and several western countries slapped sanctions on China over the same issue.Cotton is the most profitable crop in the region, and rotation to other crops is not in the interests of growers and hard to achieve on a large scale, Mei said on the WeChat account of Beijing News, a governmentrun newspaper. The only feasible option is to build more hog farms, he said, and they can use local grain to feed the pigs or import supplies from neighboring countries.Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a militaryaffiliated entity, and other groups have already started building several largescale pig farms, which will increase output significantly in the next two years. In the meantime, animal waste from the farms could be used to boost soil fertility, which has been exhausted by extensive use of chemical fertilizer, said Mei.The most desirable way to solve this problem is to raise pigs and grow cotton simultaneously, and return a large amount of manure from pig farms to the fields after treatment to enhance soil fertility and increase profits, Mei said.China should expand hog farms in areas like Xinjiang and Heilongjiang, which are less populationintensive than the inland provinces like Sichuan, Hunan and Henan which dominate the countrys pork production, Mei said. Outbreaks of African swine fever that started in 2018 slashed hog herds by as much as half and sent meat imports spiraling to a record.Updates with details from the report throughoutFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P.1d agoBloombergChinas Very Bad Bank: Inside the Huarong Debt DebacleBloomberg  Its been 11 weeks since Lai Xiaomin, the man once known as the God of Wealth, was executed on a cold Friday morning in the Chinese city of Tianjin.But his shadow still hangs over one of the most dramatic corruption stories ever to come out of China  a tale that has now set nerves on edge around the financial world.At its center is China Huarong Asset Management Co., the state financial company that Lai lorded over until getting ensnared in a sweeping crackdown on corruption by Chinas leader, Xi Jinping.From Hong Kong to London to New York, questions burn. Will the Chinese government stand behind 23.2 billion that Lai borrowed on overseas markets  or will international bond investors have to swallow losses Are key stateowned enterprises like Huarong still too big to fail, as global finance has long assumed  or will these companies be allowed to stumble, just like anyone elseThe answers will have huge implications for China and markets across Asia. Should Huarong fail to pay back its debts in full, the development would cast doubt over a core tenet of Chinese investment: the assumed government backing for important stateowned enterprises, or SOEs.A default at a central stateowned company like Huarong is unprecedented, said Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy at Australia  New Zealand Banking Group. Should one occur, he said, it would mark a watershed moment for Chinese and Asian credit markets.Not since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s has the issue weighed so heavily. Huarong bonds  among the most widely held SOE debt worldwide  recently fell to a record low of about 52 cents on the dollar. Thats not the pennies on a dollar normally associated with deeply troubled companies elsewhere, but its practically unheard of for an SOE.Fears of a nearterm default eased on Thursday after the company was said to have prepared funds for full repayment of a S600 million 450 million offshore bond due April 27. Huarong plans to pay on the due date, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private information.Thats a drop in the ocean and wont remove investor concerns. All told, Huarong owes bondholders at home and abroad the equivalent of 42 billion. Some 17.1 billion of that falls due by the end of 2022, according to Bloombergcompiled data.Bad BankIt wasnt supposed to be this way. Huarong was created in the aftermath of the 90s Asian collapse to avert another crisis, not cause one. The idea was to contain a swelling wave of bad loans threatening Chinese banks. Huarong was to serve as a bad bank, a safe repository for the billions in souring loans made to state companies.Along with three other bad banks, Huarong swapped delinquent debts for stakes in hundreds of big SOEs and, in the process, helped turn around chronic moneylosers like the giant China Petroleum  Chemical Corp.After Lai took over in 2012, Huarong reached for more, pushing into investment banking, trusts, real estate and positioning itself as a key player in Chinas 54 trillion financial industry.Before long, global banks came knocking. In 2013, for instance, Shane Zhang, cohead of AsiaPacific investment banking at Morgan Stanley, met with Lai. Zhang said his company was very optimistic about the future of Huarong, according to a statement posted on Huarongs website at the time.Before Huarong went public in Hong Kong in 2015, it sold a 2.4 billion stake to a group of investors including Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Malaysias sovereign wealth fund. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group acquired lots of stock too, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has collapsed 67 since its listing.Lai had no trouble financing his grand ambitions. A big reason: Everyone thought Beijing would always stand behind a key company like Huarong. It easily borrowed money in the offshore market at rates as low as 2.1. It borrowed still more in the domestic interbank market. Along the way Lai transformed Huarong into a powerful shadow lender, extending credit to companies that banks turned away.The truth was darker. Lai, a former senior official at the nations banking regulator, doled out loans with little oversight from his board or risk management committee.One Huarong credit officer said Lai personally called the shots on most of the offshore corporate loans underwritten by her division.Money also flowed to projects disguised as parts of Chinas push to build railroads, ports and more around the world  the socalled Belt and Road Initiative, according to an executive at a state bank. Huarong didnt immediately reply to questions on its lending practices.Given Lais fate, both people spoke on the condition of anonymity.Huarong snapped up more than half of the 510 billion yuan in distressed debts disposed of by Chinese banks in 2016. At its peak, Lais sprawling empire had almost 200 units at home and abroad. He boasted in 2017 that Huarong, having reached the Hong Kong stock exchange, would soon go public in mainland China, too.The IPO never happened. Lai was arrested in 2018 and subsequently confessed to a range of economic crimes in a state TV show. He spoke of trunkloads of cash being spirited into a Beijing apartment hed dubbed the supermarket. Authorities said they discovered 200 million yuan there. Expensive real estate, luxury watches, art, gold  the list of Lais treasure ran on.This past January, Lai was found guilty by the Secondary Intermediate Peoples Court in Tianjin of accepting of 277 million in bribes between 2008 and 2018. He was put to death three weeks later  a rare use of capital punishment for economic crimes. Some took the execution as a message from Chinas leader, Xi Jinping: my crackdown on corruption will roll on.At Huarong, the bottom has fallen out. Net income plummeted 95 from 2017 to 2019, to 1.4 billion yuan, and then sank 92 during the first half of 2020. Assets have shriveled by 165 billion yuan.The company on April 1 announced that it would delay its 2020 results, saying its auditor needed more time. The influential Caixin magazine this week openly speculated about Huarongs fate, including the possibility of bankruptcy. Its credit outlook was put on review for a potential downgrade by all three top rating firms.According to people familiar with the matter, Huarong has proposed a sweeping restructuring. The plan would involve offloading its moneylosing, noncore businesses. Huarong is still trying to get a handle on what those businesses might be worth. The proposal, which the government would have to approve, helps explain why the company delayed its 2020 results, the people said.Company executives have been meeting with peers at state banks to assuage their concerns over the past two weeks, a Huarong official said.The Chinese finance ministry has raised another possibility: transferring its stake in Huarong to a unit of the nations sovereign wealth fund that could then sort out the assorted debt problems. Regulators have held several meetings to discuss the companys plight, according to people familiar with the matter.In an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg, Huarong said it has adequate liquidity and plans to announce the expected date of its 2020 earnings release after consulting with auditors. Chinas banking and insurance regulator didnt immediately respond to a request seeking comment on Huarongs situation.News the company aims to repay a note due this month helped its bonds rebound from record lows on Thursday. Its not just about cost of funding though, said Thu Ha Chow, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles Investments Asia in Singapore. For Huarong to access the market it will need a clear and definitive commitment, from Chinas finance ministry toward the offshore debt or clarity on a restructuring, she said.One thing is sure: Huarong is part of a much bigger problem in China. Stateowned enterprises are shouldering the equivalent of 4.1 trillion in debt, and a growing number of them are struggling to keep current with creditors. In all, SOEs reneged on a record 79.5 billion yuan of local bonds in 2020, lifting their share of onshore payment failures to 57 from just 8.5 a year earlier, according to Fitch Ratings. The figure jumped to 72 in the first quarter of 2021.The shockwaves from Huarong and these broader debt problems have only begun to reverberate through Chinese finance. Dismantling all or part of Lais old empire would show Beijing is willing to accept shortterm pain to instill financial discipline among stateowned enterprises.The irony is that Huarong was supposed to fix Chinas big debt problem, not cause a new one.Allowing a stateowned financial institution that undertook the task of resolving troubles of Chinas financial system to fail is the worst way to handle risks, said Feng Jianlin, a Beijingbased chief analyst at research institute FOST. The authorities must consider the massive risk spillover effects.Updates with Loomis Sayles comment in final sectionFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P.4h agoBloombergCoinbases Whipsaw Debut Takes It Past 100 Billion, Then BackBloomberg  Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc. soared above a 112 billion valuation in its trading debut Wednesday, then slipped back below its opening price as Bitcoin fell from record highs and tech stocks fell across the board.The massive valuation, which dwarfs more traditional financial companies including Intercontinental Exchange Group Inc. and Nasdaq Inc. itself, is a landmark moment for the crypto industry and for Coinbase, which was started almost a decade ago when few people had even heard of Bitcoin, and many exchanges were run by amateurs from their garages and homes.Coinbase shares closed at 328.28, down 14 from the 381 opening price on Nasdaq after earlier climbing as high as 429.54. At the closing price, the companys valuation on a fully diluted basis is about 86 billion.Bitcoin, which along with Ethereum made up 56 of Coinbases 2020 trading revenue, dipped below 62,000 after earlier hitting a record price.The debut isnt just a mark of success for Coinbase, which was valued at just 8 billion in its most recent funding round in 2018. Its also a win for Nasdaq, which hosted its first direct listing after beating out the New York Stock Exchange for Coinbases debut. Coinbase is the biggest company to take the direct listing route to market.Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said in an interview Wednesday morning that one of the reasons that the company picked Nasdaq was because the bourse offered the ticker symbol COIN, which wasnt part of the New York Stock Exchanges pitch.Ultimately that they had the ticker COIN, and that was a really great ticker for us to get, Haas said.Nasdaq on Tuesday set a reference price of 250 a share for Coinbases direct listing, a number thats a requirement for the stock to begin trading, but not a direct indicator of the companys potential market capitalization. Every major direct listing has so far opened significantly above its reference price, with Roblox shares debuting at 64 each  42 higher than the number set by the exchange.Coinbase shares changed hands at a roughly 90 billion valuation in early March, Bloomberg News reported at the time, in what was one of the last chances for investors to trade its private stock before the company went public.Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert, whos built an empire that spans the crypto world, tweeted Tuesday that his shares would definitely not be changing hands at the reference price, in an early sign that the stock was set for a pop at the open.Direct listings are an alternative to a traditional initial public offering that has only been deployed a handful of times. Until Wednesday, every company to pursue one  including Slack Technologies Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and most recently Roblox Corp.  listed on the New York Stock Exchange.As well as the ticker, Nasdaqs ability to provide a private market for the shares, as well as services it offers such as investor relations work, were among its selling points to Coinbase, according to a person familiar with the matter.Appropriately for a company that in May said it was committing to a remotefirst work culture and doesnt list a headquarters on its filing, Coinbases pitch meetings with Nasdaq happened virtually, the person added.We evaluated both NYSE and Nasdaq and ultimately felt that the Nasdaq platform was aligned with our value as a tech company, Haas said.In a direct listing, a companys shares begin trading without it issuing new shares to raise capital. That avoids diluting the shares and also, unlike a traditional IPO, often allows the companys existing investors to put their shares on the market without waiting for lockup period  typically six months  to expire.Luring Coinbase was a win for Nasdaq, whose yearslong fight for a larger share of mega listings gained traction in the past year. Half of the 10 largest U.S. IPOs, excluding blankcheck companies, were on on Nasdaq, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That included the third largest, Airbnb Inc.s 3.8 billion IPO in December, which was the biggest listing on Nasdaq since Facebook Inc.s 16 billion monolith in 2012.Crypto UpstartsPutting his trust in the stock exchange is Coinbase Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong, who started the company with Fred Ehrsam in 2012. Unlike most rivals, Coinbases founders always envisioned strict regulatory compliance as a cornerstone of the operation, which has helped the exchange to grow in the U.S., where many early Bitcoin traders and investors were located.Ehrsam left the company in 2017, and is now investing in crypto startups. Both Armstrong and Ehrsam own huge swaths of Coinbase.Coinbase last week said it expects to report a firstquarter profit of 730 million to 800 million, more than double what it earned in all of 2020.They are going to build out a full financial services company, said Barry Schuler, a cofounder of Coinbase investor DFJ Growth who until last year sat on the companys board. Like a crypto version of a Goldman Sachs or a Morgan Stanley.Skeptics, RegulationThe companys rapid growth hasnt been without controversy, ranging from frequent outages during periods of heavy trading to new restrictions Armstrong placed on employee discussions of politics last fall. In March, Coinbase also settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for 6.5 million, after the agency said the company reported inaccurate data about transactions and that a former employee engaged in improper trades.Then there are the crypto skeptics, as well as the regulators around the world who are stepping up oversight and casting doubt on Bitcoins usefulness as a currency.European Central Bank executive board member Isabel Schnabel, in an interview this month with Der Spiegel, called Bitcoin a speculative asset without any recognizable fundamental value.A publicly traded Coinbase was unimaginable several years back when Wall Street was full of crypto bears including JPMorgan Chase  Co.s Jamie Dimon, who once called Bitcoin a fraud.Dimon later said he regretted saying that. His bank as well as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised on Coinbases direct listing.I dont think we sought Wall Streets approval but we did seek to bring more transparency to crypto and to introduce crypto to more and more users, Coinbases Haas said.Crypto PartnersWall Street can become trader of crypto. They are going to be partners of us going forward, she said.Coinbases early investors are celebrating.I think Coinbase is this decades Microsoft, Netscape, Google or Facebook, Garry Tan, founder and managing partner at Initialized Capital and an earlystage Coinbase investor, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Tuesday.Updates with closing share price in third paragraphFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P.19h agoReutersTaiwan says its chip firms will adhere to new U.S. rules blacklisting China supercomputing entitiesTaiwan said on Wednesday its chip companies will adhere to U.S. rules after Washington added seven Chinese supercomputing entities last week to an economic blacklist and after a Taipeibased chipmaker halted orders from one of the entities named.  The U.S. Commerce Department said the seven Chinese entities were involved with building supercomputers used by Chinas military actors, its destabilizing military modernisation efforts, andor weapons of mass destruction programs.  Companies or others listed on the U.S. Entity List are required to apply for licenses from the Commerce Department that face tough scrutiny when they seek permission to receive items from U.S. suppliers.1d agoReutersWorld stocks soar to fresh peaks, dollar slipsMajor global stock indexes scaled new peaks on Wednesday after upbeat U.S. and European earnings pointed to a strong recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, while the dollar dipped to threeweek lows as Treasury yields held below recent highs.  Highflying growth stocks declined on Wall Street, sending the benchmark SP 500 and Nasdaq lower in afternoon trade, while underpriced value stocks rose, lifting the Dow to a new record.  U.S. import prices increased more than expected in March, lifted by higher costs for petroleum products and tight supply chains in the latest data to show inflation is heating up as economies reopen.1d agoBloombergJPMorgan Sells an Exotic Quant Trade Chasing StockMarket WhalesBloomberg  JPMorgan Chase  Co. is tapping into retail demand for trendfollowing by giving rich investors access to a kind of complex stock strategy thats usually reserved for institutional managers.The New Yorkbased bank has issued 15 million of structured notes that give investors a way to surf SP 500 trading patterns caused by market whales including options dealers and pension funds.The thinking goes that their trading, rebalancing and hedging activity are all giving rise to seasonal cycles and momentum trends in the worlds largest stock market.The JPMorgan notes carry maturities of up to five years and track the performance of the banks Kronos index launched in December, according to SEC filings. While issuance todate is modest, the deal gives wealthy individuals  typical buyers of such securities  a novel way to ride esoteric stock trends ignited by the systematic crowd.Its a window into a hot and opaque investing style on Wall Street.The Kronos index captures the SP 500s tendency to outperform at the start and the end of each month, and to maintain its momentum going into monthly options expiry dates. A backtest suggests the gauge hasnt had a down year since 2008, when it lost 54. A spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to comment on the issuance.It makes sense to look at strategies such as this, said Matthew Yeates, head of alternative and quantitative strategy at Seven Investment Management LLP. It is difficult to see those distortions evaporating any time soon.Quants have long devised investing strategies to exploit institutional capital flows. Intraday trendfollowing for instance flourished in recent years as a way to take advantage of endofday trading by passive funds, though the style has struggled of late.At the same time, an increase in options volumes means derivatives traders are moving stocks like never before  fueling market quirks like those captured in the Kronos index.Read More: Wall Street Dealers in Hedging Frenzy Get Blamed for VolatilityOne is the propensity of the SP to move in a reliable direction in the runup to options expiry. If the benchmark has increased in the previous month, call overwriters will tend to buy back their contracts and sell new ones with higher strike prices to dealers. That in turn spurs market makers to buy the underlying equities as a hedge, according to JPMorgan. If the SP 500 has fallen, the opposite occurs.Hedging TailsThe Kronos index also seeks to exploit the tendency of the SP 500 to outperform during the first and last few days of each month, as well as its reversion to the mean into the last week of the month. All this can be attributed to the buying and selling patterns of large investors adjusting their portfolios, according to the JPMorgan prospectus.Think pension portfolios rebalancing their exposures or retirement funds buying stocks at the beginning of every month.During bouts of market volatility, these trading patterns can get magnified. In that context, trades designed to follow systematic trading flows can provide an attractive source of tail risk protection, according to Yeates.Still, like all investing styles borne out of backtests, it may ultimately struggle for traction in the real world. Smart strategies that look good on paper can misfire thanks to trading costs and market reversals.Seasonality offers alpha opportunities, but often these are theoretical rather than practical, said Nicolas Rabener, founder and CEO of FactorResearch.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P.44m agoQuartzGrabs record breaking SPAC merger left more than 2 billion on the tableGrabs recordbreaking deal to merge with a special purpose acquisition company SPAC will raise an eyepopping 4.5 billion in cash.

And the early enthusiasts likely walked away with a few bruises.Day traders purchased a net 57 million of the cryptocurrency exchanges shares during its debut Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, according to data from VandaTrack. That total accounted for 7 of the 822 million individual investors spent on all U.S. stocks and exchangetraded funds on the day, and made Coinbase the fifthmost popular debut with the demographic since 2017.They didnt wait long to jump in.Nearly a third of all retail dollars spent on Coinbase Wednesday poured in during the first 20 minutes of trading as the shares soared by 13 from the opening price of 381 to an intraday high of 429.54. Retail buying tapered off as the initial euphoria waned and the shares paired their gains to finish the day below the opening trade price.Coinbase gained as much as 6.4 in early trading Thursday on news of a 246 million investment from Cathie Woods Ark Investment Management and positive analyst coverage, though the shares remained below their opening price.Tayo Kuku, a 27year old photographer based in Washington, D.C., is among the cohort of investors who bought in. But within 10 minutes of purchasing the stock at 394 and a few conversations with his friends who are also buyers, it made me realize that I probably didnt make the best decision jumping in that quickly, he said.I obviously knew the risk of jumping in on a company as soon as it went public, but it just seemed like an obvious investment considering cryptocurrency has been the next big thing for young investors like me.Fortunately for Kuku, he managed to sell at a profit at 415. Though he left unscathed, he still plans to keep an eye out and may possibly dip my feet back in in the next few weeks.The debut of the first cryptocurrency exchange to list on a U.S. public market was widely hailed as ushering in a new era for the oftmocked asset class. That drew the attention of retail traders who piled in at a level not seen since the debut of Rocket Cos., the parent of the mortgage giant founded by billionaire Dan Gilbert, making it the fifth most popular new listing among the group since 2017.It is pretty surprising to see such strong buying, said Viraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda Research. There was obviously a lot of hype around this and certainly Coinbase will be almost the best proxy for trading the crypto theme in the coming years.On Fidelitys platform Coinbase was the most traded stock on the day. More than 148,000 shares changed hands there, nearly nine times more than runnerup Tesla Inc., according to data from the brokerage.What is fascinating about Coinbase is this is the first way in which individuals can take part in this new market for cryptocurrencies without being subject themselves to the volatility those currencies have, Michael Wolf, the chief executive officer and cofounder of Activate, a technology consulting firm, said on Bloomberg Television. We are going to see that Coinbase is going to be held widely  at this market cap, its going to be held by index funds. It will allow small investors as well as individuals to take part in this entire move toward cryptocurrencies.But for all the fanfare, Coinbase wasnt the top pick of athome traders on Wednesday. That honor went to the ProShares UltraPro QQQ exchangetraded fund ticker TQQQ, a three times levered tracker of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which saw 72 million of net retail buying on the day despite plunging by 3.5.Updates for Thursday trading in the fifth paragraph.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.2021 Bloomberg L.P.54m agoOilprice.comCould This Be One Of The Best Ways To Play The Electric Vehicle BoomIn the notsodistant future, a majority of drivers probably wont even own the cars they drive in, instead they may join the rising phenomenon of car subscription services15h agoBBCSanjeev Guptas firm says it did nothing wrong over Covid loansThe company behind the UKs Liberty Steel says it did nothing wrong when seeking government funds.3h agoYahoo FinanceJPMorgan Q1 earnings blow past estimates Dimon sees extremely robust, multiyear growthThe firm released 5.2 billion of credit reserves, bolstering EPS.1d agoReutersCredit Suisse offers big blocks of Discovery, iQIYI shares related to Archegos: sourcesCredit Suisse has not yet finished unwinding its Archegos positions, said one source familiar with the matter.

{"id":93,"cleaned text":"Colorado lawmakers look to AI to detect wildfires early FILE  A helicopter drops water on flames from the Alturas Fire across Powers Blvd. from the Amazon Distribution Center on Thursday, May 12, 2022. A bill introduced FILE  A helicopter drops water on flames from the Alturas Fire across Powers Blvd. from the Amazon Distribution Center on Thursday, May 12, 2022.  A bill introduced in the Colorado legislature would create a 2 million pilot program to use cameras, likely with AI technology, in highrisk locations to help identify fires before they burn out of control. Jerilee BennettThe Gazette via AP, File DENVER AP  A year after the most destructive wildfire in the states history scorched nearly 1,100 homes, Colorado lawmakers are considering joining other Western states by adopting artificial intelligence in hopes of detecting blazes before they burn out of control. A proposal that legislators will discuss in a hearing Thursday would create a 2 million pilot program to mount cameras on mountaintops in highrisk locations. An artificial intelligence program developed by a private company would analyze the images and sounds from cameras with 10mile about 16kilometer radiuses in hopes of detecting something that could signal the start of a blaze. It is part of an ongoing effort by firefighters to use new technology to become smarter in how they prepare and better position their resources. Fire lookout towers once staffed by humans have largely been replaced with cameras in remote areas, many of them in highdefinition and armed with artificial intelligence to discern a smoke plume from morning fog.  There are hundreds of such cameras scattered across California, Nevada and Oregon, and even casual viewers can remotely watch wildfires in real time. A historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West and scientists say warming weather will continue to make fires more frequent and destructive. Recordbreaking storms that drenched California with more than 11 inches of rain in recent weeks and big snow dumps in other states have improved conditions in the shortterm, but the drought persists across most of Nevada, California and Utah, and large areas of other Western states, according to a Tuesday report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The goal with the Colorado program is for cameras and an AI algorithm to detect a plume of smoke and alert first responders who can stomp out the blaze before it grows, said Don Coram, a former Republican Colorado state senator who first backed the idea and encouraged this years sponsor, Rep. Cleave Simpson, a Republican and rancher. Once these fires get into cresting in the tree tops, its going to take a lot of resources, a lot of manpower, and a lot of good luck to knock them down, Coram said.  Thursdays hearing will include testimony from a AI wildfire detection company called Pano AI. The company began working with cities, including the ski resort town of Aspen, Colorado, and has expanded to cities and counties in six states. Their stations include two cameras mounted on a high vantage point, rotating at 360 degrees and connected to the companys AI software. Each station costs roughly 50,000 every year.  Arvind Satyam, the chief commercial officer at Pano AI, said that the artificial intelligence uses a dataset of over 300 million images that teaches it what is smoke from a fire and what isnt. Once a camera signals that there could be a fire, the photos and information are run through the companys intelligence center for human vetting  the algorithm couldve mistaken a tractors dust cloud or even geyser for a smoke plume  before its sent along to fire agencies, he said.  AI has gained notoriety for breaking into a number of fields  from creating propaganda and disinformation to writing essays or cover letters about whatever the user requests.  David Blankinship, senior technology advisor for the Western Fire Chiefs Association, said fire agencies have come to rely on this type of detection technology, especially in California where the programs have been put to wider use.  It loops around in a 360 all the time and searching for pixel changes that the human eye might not detect, said Blankinship, adding that anything you can do to take time out of the response to that fire saves lives. Still, Blankinship noted that these cameras, even with AI, are only one component of the actual solution that is working. That solution includes civilians calling in fires, other equipment such as smoke sensors, aircrafts that gather detailed information by flying over the burns, and even satellites providing broader information on a burns size, Blankinship said.  All those systems, including cameras fitted with AI, allow fire authorities to model a wildfire and consequently better make difficult decisions about where and when to evacuate, how many engines to dedicated to a certain fire, or if burns should be extinguished at all.  To Coram, who will be attending the hearing on Thursday, the bill just makes too much sense not to do. I look around at all the rooftops that I can see, and think, My god, when this catches on fire, what are we going to do said Coram.

{"id":94,"cleaned text":"Border Patrol adds artificial intelligence cameras to security arsenal Technology helping border agents identify threats and rescue injured migrants abandoned by smugglers VAN HORN, Texas Border Report  Disoriented and hungry, the young woman from Guatemala slowly walked out of a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle and sat on a metal bench next to a cinderblock wall. An agent instructed her to remove filthy camouflage pants and shirt while an interpreter inside the Border Patrol station questioned her in Spanish. Before they abandoned you, where did they tell you to go he asked as she removed two of the three layers of clothing she wore. They told you to go to Interstate 10, do you know what 10 is No, said the 18yearold named Dina in a soft voice barely above a whisper. She was rescued by a helicopter crew from the Wiley Mountains east of Van Horn, where she spent a day and a night alone after hurting her foot. The group of 26 migrants she was traveling with took off without her when they spotted an approaching Border Patrol vehicle. I turned on my telephone and asked the smuggler what I should do. He told me to walk to a mountain, that another smuggler would help me. But there was no one there. I called again but he stopped taking my calls and texts, Dina told Border Report, declining to give her last name. A nurse assistant took her inside the station. She was to receive a medical exam and taste food for the first time in three days. Border agents in the past five months have participated in 6,630 search and rescues of migrants along the Southwestern border. Theyre hoping newly deployed technology will help them not only stop human smugglers and drug couriers but also render lifesaving aid to atrisk individuals. Anybody that falls behind is left behind, said Jose Aleman, agent in charge of the U.S. Border Patrol station in Van Horn. Theyre not familiar with the area so its easy to get lost one mountain looks like the other. They can walk around in circles. We are constantly rescuing people and finding people that pass away because of the elements. Border Patrol Agent Jose Aleman, chief agent for the Van Horn Station, examines a backpack abandoned by a migrant in the desert. Border Report At least 650 people died last year crossing the U.S.Mexico border, succumbing to extreme heat, cold or hunger, according to the International Organization for Migration. Border Patrol agents east of El Paso are using artificial intelligence cameras and other technology to detect and rescue migrants in mountain and desert terrain. The cameras detect changes in landscape and track individuals and groups in the desert. They have been a gamechanger, a force multiplier, Aleman said. They detect anything within its area, give us the exact location of folks coming through here. They narrow down the response time, narrow down apprehension time so we can quickly move on to other areas where activity is detected. The socalled autonomous surveillance towers, coupled with emergency beacons, metal placards with calling instructions and helicopters have led to the rescue of more than two dozen migrants near Van Horn in the past few months. The cameras have a 3mile visual radius and night vision technology. Mounted atop 33foot metal poles, they can also give agents cues as to whether anyone in a large group may be carrying a weapon. The towers automatically hand off from one to the other if a group goes out of one cameras sight. With a rotary mount, the cameras radar is always on scan mode. The towers and beacons are solarpowered. Many are in private land.  Aleman said the Border Patrol has received the support of ranchers and other property owners concerned with the increasing migrant traffic. The problem isnt so much criminal activity as selfpreservation acts such as getting water by cutting hoses leading from reservoirs to cattle feeding grounds and sneaking into farm sheds to protect themselves from the elements. Border Patrol deploys emergency beacons to assist migrants in distress in remote areas Theres good cooperation with the community. Theres good cooperation with other lawenforcement agencies like the Texas Department of Public Safety and local sheriffs offices, he said. Aleman, a 22year veteran of the Border Patrol has seen his share of deceased migrants over the years. He talked about the recovery of five bodies in the desert after a snowstorm last year and rescuing a middleaged woman whose fingers turned black from frostbite.  But none was as dramatic as a man he found over a line fence in a ranch within sight of Interstate 10, where someone might have been able to render aid, he said. Border Patrol officials like Aleman lay those deaths at the feet of transnational criminal organizations and the human smugglers they employ. They sell them on a trip and lie to them at every turn. They place them in stash houses packed with 100 other people, exposed to COVID and other diseases. Some they get greedy, and it turns into kidnapping they hold them until relatives send more money than they agreed to, the chief agent said. And once over here, theyre only concerned about those that can walk and that theyre going to get paid for. Other dangers include transporting a dozen or more individuals in a single sedan at high speeds over busy Texas roads. Those vehicles have been known to overturn, injuring and killing the occupants. Dina, an 18yearold Guatemalan migrant, talks to Border Reports Julian Resendiz after being rescued by the Border Patrol from the mountains near Van Horn, Texas. Border Report photo The trip is especially dangerous for women, who often share with their medical screener that theyve been sexually assaulted. We understand the migrants are doing what they feel they need to do. But we hope the message gets out how things really are. Its not worth it, he said. Dina, the rescued Guatemalan migrant, said she shared the news with her parents of how her trip came to a sudden end. They are very sad, she said, adding they incurred a 3,250 debt to get her to the United States. But when asked what her plans were, she said she is hoping to join her sister, find work in the U.S. and economically help out her family in Guatemala. With the smugglers unlikely to write off the fee, she might have little choices left. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

In a study, the cars cruise control was modified to react to Specially equipped cars sit in a parking lot Thursday, Nov. 17, 2022, in Nashville, Tenn. In a study, the cars cruise control was modified to react to the overall flow of traffic using artificial intelligence. The aim is to influence a phenomenon called a phantom traffic jam  the startandstop congestion on crowded roads that has no obvious cause. AP PhotoMark Humphrey NASHVILLE, Tenn. AP  As millions of people travel the interstates this Thanksgiving, many will encounter patches of traffic at a standstill for no apparent reason  no construction or accident. Researchers say the problem is you.  Human drivers just dont do a good job of navigating dense traffic conditions, but an experiment using artificial intelligence in Nashville last week means help could be on the way. In the experiment, specially equipped cars were able to ease rush hour congestion on Interstate24, researcher Daniel Work said on Tuesday. In addition to lessening driver frustration, Work said less stopandgo driving means fuel savings and, by extension, less pollution. The professor of civil and environmental engineering at Vanderbilt University is one of a group of engineers and mathematicians from universities around the U.S. who have been studying the problem of phantom traffic jams after a simple experiment in Japan a dozen years ago showed how they develop. Researchers there put about 20 human drivers on a circular track and asked them to drive at a constant speed. Before long, traffic went from a smooth flow to a series of stops and starts.  Phantom traffic jams are created by drivers like you and me, Work explained.  One person taps the brakes for whatever reason. The person behind them takes a second to respond and has to brake even harder. The next person has to brake even harder. The wave of braking continues until many cars are at a standstill. Then, as traffic clears, the drivers accelerate too quickly, causing more braking and yet another jam. We know that one car braking suddenly can have a huge impact, Work said. Last weeks experiment showed that a few cars driving slowly and steadily could have an impact as well, for the better.  The experiment utilized 100 cars that travelled in loops on a 15mile section of I24 from about 6 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. each morning. Working on the premise that if 5 of the cars on the road were acting together, they could lessen the prevalence of phantom traffic jams, the researchers equipped those 100 cars to communicate wirelessly, sending traffic information back and forth. They also took advantage of the adaptive cruise control that is already an option on many new vehicles. This technology lets the driver set a car to cruise at a certain speed, but the car automatically slows down and speeds up as needed to keep a safe distance from the car in front. In the experiment, the adaptive cruise control was modified to react to the overall traffic flow  including what was happening far ahead  using artificial intelligence. The cars decisionmaking occurred on two levels, Work said. At the cloud level, information about traffic conditions was used to create an overall speed plan. That plan was then broadcast to the cars, which used artificial intelligence algorithms to determine the best action to take. The researchers were able to evaluate the effect the connected cars had on morning traffic flow using a special 4mile stretch of I24 outfitted with 300 polemounted sensors.  The experiment is a project of the CIRCLES consortium, a group that includes several automakers and the U.S. Energy and Transportation departments. Other lead researchers are based at the University of California, Berkeley Temple University and Rutgers UniversityCamden.  Liam Pedersen is deputy general manager for research at Nissan, a CIRCLES consortium partner who was in Nashville last week for the experiment. He said one of the exciting things about it is that it builds on technology that is already in many new cars. This is not autonomous driving, he said. This is something we could realize very soon. Asked if automakers will be willing to cooperate to ease traffic, Pedersen said, I certainly hope so, because the system works best when lots and lots of cars participate. Last weeks experiment built off one Work and his colleagues conducted in 2017 at the University of Arizona. That repeated the Japanese experiment, this time with a single selfdriving car thrown into the mix. The selfdriving car smoothed the flow of traffic so that there was 98 less braking. That led to a 40 increase in fuel efficiency and a 14 increase in distance driven. Researchers are still crunching the numbers on last weeks experiment, but Work said it demonstrated that these jams can be reduced through the novel automated vehicle technologies we developed. Its unquestionable that enhanced automotive technology can significantly reduce phantom traffic jams when implemented at scale. Still, he cautioned that the technology is not going to suddenly eliminate congestion.  When there are more cars on the road than the road can support, there will always be traffic, he said. But this can make that congestion less painful. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

{"id":108,"cleaned text":"How 5G, WiFi 6 and AI will provide a smarter home experience The smart home revolution is truly underway. With reality taking a little time to catch up to the hyperbole femtocellpowered smart fridges, anyone, it has now become the norm. In fact, according to a 2019 survey by Smart Home Week, 57 percent of UK homes are now equipped with some sort of smart device, and 45 percent of households are planning to make their homes even smarter in the future.The demand for smart home technology is driving diversification in device categories  virtually any appliance you can think of comes in a connected variant today  and also opening up new ways in which advanced technologies like AI and 5G can be used to drive new consumer experiences.The 5G impactThere a number of technologies driving innovation today but at the head of that queue is arguably 5G. Already it is opening doors for all kinds of consumer devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and everyday appliances. With 5G, all these devices will constantly connect and communicate with each other. Every new generation of cellular network promises faster speeds and that is certainly the case with 5G: potentially 40 times faster than the latest version of 4G. Superfast connectivity is complemented by lowlatency to offer instantaneous AI for a smart experience whether using a TV at home or voice assistant at work.Smartphones are leading the way in this space purely through competitive differentiation: according to Strategy Analytics, Q1 2020 saw more 5G smartphones shipped than all of 2019. Smartphone manufacturers are now favoring unique chipsets that deliver enhanced 5G technology, powerefficiency and higherquality framebyframe imagery for video and gaming, in order to meet the demands of users. This trend is undoubtedly making its way to other devices in the home including Smart TVs.What will 5G mean for products like Smart TVs TV broadcasting, especially when it comes to live broadcasts will be better than ever. Performance will improve massively which will be useful for more immersive Virtual Reality VR and 360video content when watching things such as live sport. All this requires 5Gs combination of speed and low latency. MediaTek showcased some of these experiences by streaming an 8K video to a smart TV using 5G connectivity from the Dimensity chipset series. 5G will also drive advancements in voicebased computing, making machine learning a lot easier and their recognition and response times will be nearly instantaneous.Tackling the dreaded lagThe smart home concept is predicated on the fact it makes the chores in life quicker and simpler. But how about when you can ask your voice assistant to turn on the kitchen lights or play your favorite song while youre streaming Netflix on your Smart TV and suddenly your internet starts to lag Having these incredible devices all working in tandem at home will inevitably use a large amount of WiFi bandwidth. Thats where WiFi 6 comes in to improve the user experience.WiFi 6, the newest WiFi standard, solves data traffic conflicts by rescheduling multiusers packets and providing higher internet data rates to eliminate lag time while playing online games, streaming videos and listening to music, all at once. This means a smoother, more seamless experience across the board.AI and the smart homeWhen it comes to a smoother smart home experience, AI technology is the key. Voice assistant technology is wellestablished in smart speakers but consumers want that same experience in more devices, from their microwaves to dishwashers. Incorporating AI in these everyday home appliances allows you to control them using a smart virtual assistant like the Amazon Alexa devices. This brings enhanced features to myriad products with the ability to connect via WiFi and use voice and smartphone controls.Incorporating Edge AI technology will bring these enhanced features to life and take the consumer experience to the next level. Time is of the essence, and faster response times is crucial. Edge AI sets devices apart, bringing network intelligence to the network edge. Rather than sending and processing information in the cloud, devices are able to do so locally on a device. This ultimately reduces lag time for the user and provides them with a user experience that feels instantaneous.The future state of smart homes will rely on the quality of the connectivity of the devices. Being able to leverage 5G, WiFi 6 and AI is vital to delivering faster and smoother connectivity as well as unrivaled visual and sound quality within the home. As savvy consumers grow more and more accustomed to the benefits of functionality such as voice assistants they will only want to see this technology applied further and powering devices throughout their homes. In response, the industry will increasingly tailor their products to meet these needs, with intelligent connectivity at the heart of their offerings.Pascal LeMasson, AVP, Head of Business Development and Sales Europe, MediaTek.Weve featured the best smart home security systems.

{"id":111,"cleaned text":"How to Improve Model Quality in Machine LearningJune 7th 2021 @modzyModzyA software platform for organizations and developers to responsibly deploy, monitor, and get value from AI  at scale.Editor note Schedule for Monday, June 7Model quality is inextricably linked to training data. Today, having powerful computers and computational software makes it easy to build machine learning models that perform perfectly on training datasets.However, the downfall of these supposedly perfect models is their poor performance on previously unseen data. Figure 1 shows an illustration of this: the sample model, shown in orange, perfectly interpolates the training data black data points. However, given any unseen data point, the sample model will produce a highly incorrect output with respect to the true model, shown in blue.This is because the sample model isbiased, or wasoverfit, to the training dataset. A highquality model has low error, while being able togeneralize, i.e. a model that adaptscorrectlyto new, previously unseensamples 1. At Modzy, were using techniques likecrossvalidationandregularizationto ensuremodel generalizabilityand to prevent overfitting.Figure 1: Visualization of BiasVariance DilemmaWhatYou Need to KnowModel quality is dependent on two main optimization tasks, minimizing the model error over thetraining datasetand maximizing model confidence over unknown samples to prevent overfitting. This is commonly referred to as thebiasvariance dilemma.kfold crossvalidation CV is a technique that can be used during the training process that ensures model quality and generalizability. The training data is divided intoksubsets, typically assigningk1subsets for model training and a single subset for testing and evaluation.This process is then repeatedktimes with different subsets used for training, testing and evaluation, as shown in Figure 2 the yellow box represents the testing set. The evaluation scores for each fold are then averaged. The risk of overfitting is minimized by using nonoverlapping testing subsets in each fold, and the final average performance represents an unbiased score of how the model handles unseen samples.Most machine learning models require input hyperparameters that are used during training. They are unknown a priori and therefore need to be optimized, which is a process calledmodel selection.The best practice, in this case, is to usenested kfold crossvalidation, which eliminates the generalization error of the underlying model and its hyperparameter search. Tuning the hyperparameters using nonnestedkfold CV biases the model to the data set, resulting in an overoptimistic score 2. Nestedkfold CV uses a series of traintestvalidation splits.In the innerkfold loop, the model performance is approximately maximized by fitting the model to each training set, and then directly maximized in selecting the hyperparameters over the validation set. In the outer loop, the generalization error is then estimated by averaging the model performance score over the test datasets that have not been used in the inner loopRegularization techniques are also used to preventing overfitting during model training. As mentioned previously, the best way to produce a highquality machine learning model during training is to minimize the model error calculated using a loss function and maximize generalizability calculated using a regularization term.Regularization techniques allow these two terms to be given priority using a scalar hyperparameter, , which scales the regularization term. For example, if a dataset is known to be very noisy, can be set to be a large number, giving model generalization priority over minimizing error. Unfortunately, is not known a priori and will have to be tuned usingkfold CV.Modzy Approach to Model Quality and Training DataUnderstanding the methods and effects of overfitting is imperative when designing and training machine learning models, and at Modzy, we take the necessary steps to ensure all our models are generalizable to previously unseen data samples.What This Means for YouModzy provides a collection of machine learning models that are guaranteed to be unbiased towards the datasets that they were trained on, making them generalizable to unseen samples. The data science team at Modzy recognizes the importance of balancing model bias and variance to ensure quality performance and transparent model assessment.References:1ShalevShwartz, Shai, and Shai BenDavid.

Diagnostics artificial intelligenceprostate cancerResearchBetter Treatmentaccurate diagnosisResearchers develop AI system to detect and grade prostate cancerThe AIsystem has the potential to solve one of the bottlenecks in the modern prostate cancer histopathology by providing more accurate diagnosis and better treatment decisions, the researchers said. IANS    January 10, 2020, 16:30 IST  Researchers have developed a method based on artificial intelligence AI for diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer.The AIsystem has the potential to solve one of the bottlenecks in the modern prostate cancer histopathology by providing more accurate diagnosis and better treatment decisions, they said.The study, published in the journal The Lancet Oncology, shows that the AIsystem is as good at identifying and grading prostate cancer as worldleading uropathologists.Our results show that it is possible to train an AIsystem to detect and grade prostate cancer on the same level as leading experts, said study researcher Martin Eklund, Associate Professor at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.This has the potential to significantly reduce the workload of uropathologists and allow them to focus on the most difficult cases, Eklund added.A problem in modern prostate pathology is that there is a certain degree of subjectivity in the assessments of the biopsies. Different pathologists can reach different conclusions even though they are studying the same samples. This leads to a clinical problem where the doctors must pick treatment based on ambiguous information, the study said.In this context, the researchers see significant potential to use the AItechnology to increase the reproducibility of the pathological assessments.To train and test the AI system, the researchers digitized more than 8,000 biopsies taken from some 1,200 Swedish men in the ages of 5069 to highresolution images using digital pathology scanners. About 6,600 of the samples were used to train the AI system to spot the difference between biopsies with or without cancer. The remaining samples, and additional sets of samples collected from other labs, were used to test the AI system. Its results were also compared against the assessments of 23 worldleading uropathologists.The findings showed that the AIsystem was almost nearperfect in determining whether a sample contained cancer or not, as well as in estimating the length of the cancer tumor in the biopsy. When it comes to determining the severity of the prostate cancer, the socalled Gleason score, the AI system was on par with the international experts.The initial findings are promising but more validation is needed before the AI system may be rolled out broadly in clinical practice, according to the researchers.Follow and connect with us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedinRELATED Tags : Diagnostics, artificial intelligence, prostate cancer, Research, Better Treatment, accurate diagnosis Strides appoints R Ananthanarayanan as CEO, MD Drug firm Strides Pharma Science on Wednesday said its board has appointed R Ananthanarayanan as Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the company effective January 09.Rehan A.

{"id":126,"cleaned text":"Riffusion tweaks Stable Diffusion to make AI text to image spectrograms to play audio Riffusion tweaks Stable Diffusion to make AI text to image spectrograms play audioTweaks to the system have finetuned images of spectrogramsStephen Vicinanza Dec 15, 2022 02:27 PM ESTCreated: Dec 15, 2022 02:27 PM ESTinnovationSound wavesmerovingianiStockStable Diffusion has been tweaked to include an update to its AI routines to include a finetuning of the images of spectrograms that are paired to text. Now they are able to generate more precise sounds. The team calls their version of the stable diffusion model, Riffusion. There is audio processing, also but that happens later in the cycle or downstream of the model.  See Also All the Stable Diffusion features remainThe tweaks have enabled the system to now have unlimited variations of the prompt. This is accomplished by varying the seed. The outofthebox features are all there, including img2img, negative prompts, interpolation, and negative prompts. What is a spectrogramSpectrograms are visual representations of audio sound waves, like someone singing or talking. In an audio spectrogram, the sound is represented and mapped on a graph. The XAxis is the time duration, and the YAxis is the frequency of the sound. Each frequency can have a time designation and is represented by the color of the pixels, which gives the amplitude. The time goes by the row and column in the image. Stable Diffusion uses a Shorttime Fourier transform STFT to compute the spectrogram image, The STFT approximates the sound using a series of sine waves in the various phases and amplitudes. The STFT denotes the frequency and phase content of local signals as they change over time. These signal variations can be calculated, inverted and then displayed in a spectrogram. How a spectrogram becomes soundIn Stable Diffusions model the amplitude of the sine wave, but not the phases of the audio. This is due in large part to the chaotic nature of phases. This shifting of phases is hard for the AI to learn.  Most Popular The model uses instead, a particular algorithm called the GriffinLim in order to approximate the shifts in phase, as the audio clip is reconstructed into a spectrogram. The spectrogram is generated and further along in the AI system is downstream converted to audio. Diffusion models for Image to Image generationIt is possible to condition the creations of the diffusion model to work with text and images. The Stable Diffusion team states that this is a useful modifier to sounds, while still keeping the original sound slip. There can be deviations to the new image prompt from many different types of original clips using the denoising strength parameter. In these spectrogram images, you can handle isolating sounds as if having multiple tracks on a recording tape, generated from an original image. Generating long audio clipsThe shorter audio clips, generated from the spectrogram, are very exciting, but the real function of the Stable Diffusion AI system is to generate infinite AIgenerated audio, like songs and instrumentals. If the AI is used on 100 clips there can be no concatenating of those clips, because of all the differences in tempo, key, tonal quality, and rhythm. The way to get around this problem is to use one image. Taking one image and generating multiple variations of the original in an image to image denoising for isolating particular instruments and sounds. Using different seeds and prompts preserves the original vital properties of the clips. Utilizing at the beginning of the process an initial image that are an exact number of measures. A beginning and an end, and then creating a loop of clip. This still doesnt make the entire audio clip a smooth sounding song from beginning to end. To make it smooth as jazzThe multiple interpretations of the images one to the next causes abrupt changes in the playback. To create smooth transitions the seed and prompts have to be interpolated in the latent space of the model. This happens in diffusion models, the latent space is a feature vector which embeds the entire model in the most possible space. This allows the model to generate smoother transitions and create close relationships between prompts and seed. At this point the model can be set in motion infinitely in long playback of the clips, or as a song generated from spectrograms in realtime.  .

{"id":138,"cleaned text":"Bill Gates: AI will be teaching kids literacy within 18 months  AI chatbots could be used to improve childrens reading and writing skills within the next 18 months, according to Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates. In a fireside chat at the ASUGSV Summit in San Diego, Gates explained that the AIs will get to that ability, to be as good a tutor as any human ever could. AI chatbots such as OpenAIs ChatGPT and Googles Bard have developed rapidly in recent months and can now compete with humanlevel intelligence on some standardised tests. Teaching writing skills has traditionally been difficult for computers, as they lack the cognitive ability to replicate human thought processes, Gates said. However, AI chatbots are able to recognise and recreate humanlike language. New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose has already used ChatGPT to improve his writing, using the AIs ability to quickly search through online style guides. Some academics have also been impressed by chatbots ability to summarise and offer feedback on text or even to write full essays. The technology must improve before it can become a viable tutor, and Gates said that AI must get better at reading and recreating human language to better motivate students. While it may be surprising that chatbots are expected to excel at reading and writing before maths, the latter is often used to develop AI technology and chatbots have difficulties with mathematical calculations. If a solved math equation already exists within the datasets that the chatbot is trained on, it can provide the answer. However, calculating its own solution is more complex and requires improved reasoning abilities, Gates explained. Gates is confident that the technology will improve within the next two years and he believes that it could help make private tutoring available to a wide range of students who may not otherwise be able to afford it. While some free versions of chatbots already exist, Gates expects that more advanced versions will be available for a fee, although he believes that they will be more affordable and accessible than oneonone tutoring with a human instructor.

{"id":141,"cleaned text":"ChatGPT passes exams from law and business schools  ChatGPT is smart enough to pass prestigious graduatelevel exams  though not with particularly high marks. The powerful new AI chatbot tool recently passed law exams in four courses at the University of Minnesota and another exam at University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School of Business, according to professors at the schools. To test how well ChatGPT could generate answers on exams for the four courses, professors at the University of Minnesota Law School recently graded the tests blindly. After completing 95 multiple choice questions and 12 essay questions, the bot performed on average at the level of a C student, achieving a low but passing grade in all four courses. ChatGPT fared better during a business management course exam at Wharton, where it earned a B to B grade. In a paper detailing the performance, Christian Terwiesch, a Wharton business professor, said ChatGPT did an amazing job at answering basic operations management and processanalysis questions but struggled with more advanced prompts and made surprising mistakes with basic math. The test results come as a growing number of schools and teachers express concerns about the immediate impact of ChatGPT on students and their ability to cheat on assignments. Some educators are now moving with remarkable speed to rethink their assignments in response to ChatGPT, even as it remains unclear how widespread use is of the tool among students and how harmful it could really be to learning. Since it was made available in late November, ChatGPT has been used to generate original essays, stories and song lyrics in response to user prompts. It has drafted research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists. Some CEOs have even used it to write emails or do accounting work. ChatGPT is trained on vast amounts of online data in order to generate responses to user prompts. While it has gained traction among users, it has also raised some concerns, including about inaccuracies and its potential to perpetuate biases and spread misinformation. Jon Choi, one of the University of Minnesota law professors, told CNN the goal of the tests was to explore ChatGPTs potential to assist lawyers in their practice and to help students in exams, whether or not its permitted by their professors, because the questions often mimic the writing lawyers do in real life. ChatGPT struggled with the most classic components of law school exams, such as spotting potential legal issues and deep analysis applying legal rules to the facts of a case, Choi said. But ChatGPT could be very helpful at producing a first draft that a student could then refine. He argues humanAI collaboration is the most promising use case for ChatGPT and similar technology. My strong hunch is that AI assistants will become standard tools for lawyers in the near future, and law schools should prepare their students for that eventuality, he said. Of course, if law professors want to continue to test simple recall of legal rules and doctrines, theyll need to put restrictions in place like banning the internet during exams to enforce that. Likewise, Whartons Terwiesch found the chatbot was remarkably good at modifying its answers in response to human hints, such as reworking answers after pointing out an error, suggesting the potential for people to work together with AI. In the shortterm, however, discomfort remains with whether and how students should use ChatGPT. Public schools in New York City and Seattle, for example, have already banned students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the districts networks and devices. Considering ChatGPT performed above average on his exam, Terwiesch told CNN he agrees restrictions should be put in place for students while theyre taking tests. Bans are needed, he said. After all, when you give a medical doctor a degree, you want them to know medicine, not how to use a bot. The same holds for other skill certification, including law and business. But Terwiesch believes this technology still ultimately has a place in the classroom. If all we end up with is the same educational system as before, we have wasted an amazing opportunity that comes with ChatGPT, he said. TheCNNWire   2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Walker Gall, an F35 pilot with the U.S. 48th Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath in England. Thats definitely not something that any of us look forward to.

And if thats the way of the future, thats what it is. But Im just here to enjoy it while I can. The future for fighter pilots was on display this week at the Farnborough International Airshow near London, one of the worlds biggest aviation, defense and aerospace expos.Defense contractors outlined how artificial intelligence and other technologies will be used in the newest warplanes as global military delegations browsed mockups of missiles, drones and fighter jets. At stake are many billions of dollars as countries update military fleets or pump up defense procurement budgets amid rising geopolitical tensions. The original Top Gun movie released in 1986 follows Tom Cruises hotshot Navy pilot, Pete Maverick Mitchell, through fighter weapons training school. In the sequel, an aging Maverick, now a test pilot, learns the top secret hypersonic plane hes working on is being canceled so the funding can be used for a pilotless drone program. Its a debate thats been playing out for years in the real world. Drones have been used extensively in the war between Russia and Ukraine and other modern conflicts, raising the question of just how much need there is for human pilots to fly expensive fighter jets and other aircraft  or whether unmanned aerial vehicles could do the job. At the Farnborough show, experts said the future of air warfare is likely to be manned and unmanned aircraft working together. One day, fighter pilots will have a drone aircraft thats flying as a loyal wingman under their control, said Jon Norman, a vice president at Raytheon Technologies Corp.s missile and defense business.Norman, a retired U.S. Air Force pilot, said he used to complain about drones controlled from the ground that got in his way when he was flying fighter jets.The latest communications systems let fighters, drones and other aircraft talk to each other, he said. Technology has already removed the need for a second person to sit in the backseat to work the radar  a role portrayed in the original Top Gun movie by the character Goose. It will continue to play a bigger role in the cockpit, Raytheon executives said. Artificial intelligence will analyze reams of data from sensors placed on planes, drones, the ground or missiles flying through the air to give pilots in the sky and commanders back at headquarters a better sense of the battlefield. In future battles, AI might allow a pilot to send an armed drone close to an enemy position and have them just fire at will, Norman added.But its too soon to write an epitaph for the pilot.If we had had this conversation 20 years ago, almost everyone was certain that some drones would be serving in a combat aircraft replacement role. That simply hasnt happened, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory. Nowadays, he said, drones mainly support manned military aircraft, which allows them to get out there with a greater combat aircraft punch. There was speculation that the F35 fighter, which went into operation in 2015, would be the last manned fighter jet, said Gareth Jennings, aviation editor at defense intelligence provider Janes. But no one says that anymore. The F35, built by Lockheed Martin Corp., is a stealthy fighter part of todays generation of warplanes. There is a next generation of fighter jets in the concept stages offering even more hightech advances, including potentially pilotless versions, but they wont arrive before the next decade at the earliest. Gall, who recently graduated from fighter pilot training school, said the F35 is easy to fly and that technology would likely make its successors even easier. But he stressed that the fighter pilots role would remain intense.Even if that role isnt going away anytime soon, the Pentagon is working on transforming it.The Air Combat Evolution program, run by the Pentagons DARPA research agency, is working on incorporating artificial intelligence into warfighting, including designing a plane that can fly itself in a dogfight. The program has already carried out a live simulation of air combat, pitting a virtual plane piloted by an AI agent against a human pilot. If all goes well, researchers plan to carry out a live dogfight with AIenabled planes by 2024.Experts, though, are skeptical pilots will be eliminated from the cockpit in the near future.I dont think well be at the stage of not needing fighter pilots for a few decades yet, said Jennings, the aviation editor. Unmanned technology and the public willingness to accept not having a human in the loop are just not there, and wont be for at least another 30 years or so.Videojournalist Cassandra Allwood contributed to this report.For all of APs tech coverage, visit https:apnews.comapftechnologyFollow Kelvin Chan at www.twitter.comchanman Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

A Japanese company will build a 150 million plant to make copper foil for electric vehicle batteries in Augusta, Georgia. Wednesdays announcement switches the location for the Nippon Denkai plant from one originally announced next to the companys existing plant in Camden, South Carolina. The company says it could eventually triple production at the Georgia site. That would raise investment to 450 million and create 250 jobs over the next five years. Nippon Denkai says the Augusta site has room for expansion, allows for more advanced equipment and has cheaper electricity prices. The company says expanding battery manufacturing will drive a big increase in demand for copper foil. Georgia officials are close to finalizing a deal with automaker Hyundai to build a 5.5 billion electric car plant near Savannah. An economic development agency representing four Savannaharea counties approved its portions of the agreement Tuesday, including an economic incentives package. Details wont be released until state officials and Hyundai also sign the deal. Hyundai plans to hire at least 8,100 to work at the Georgia plant, which is scheduled to open in 2025. State and local governments spent 61 million to purchase the plant site and 66 million to prepare it. Incentives include an income tax credit worth an estimated 213 million. President Joe Biden is promising strong executive action to combat climate change, despite setbacks that have restricted his ability to regulate carbon emissions and boost clean energy such as wind and solar power. The Supreme Court last month limited how the nations main antiair pollution law can be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. And this past week, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said he wants to delay sweeping environmental legislation that Democrats have pushed as central to achieving Bidens ambitious climate goals. Biden has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. On Friday, he said action on climate change and clean energy remains more urgent than ever. Jury: Tesla just 1 to blame for teen drivers fiery crash A jury in Florida has found Tesla just 1 negligent for disabling a speed limiter on an electric car involved in a fiery crash that killed two teens. Tuesdays verdict places 90 of the blame on the 18yearold driver. Barret Riley and his friend were killed just as they were set to graduate from high school. Jurors also found the teens father 9 responsible for enabling what Tesla called a history of speeding and reckless driving. The verdict awards 6 million in damages to the boys mother and 4.5 million to his father. The U.S. Postal Service plans to further increase the number of electricpowered vehicles it is buying to replace its aging fleet of delivery trucks. The Postal Service anticipates boosting electric vehicles from 20 to 50 of its initial purchase of 50,000 vehicles in a new environmental filing. It also proposes buying more than 34,000 commercially available vehicles over two years. The proposed changes are to be posted in the Federal Register on Thursday. They follow lawsuits by 16 states seeking to halt purchases under the initial proposal that called for a greater number of gaspowered trucks. YouTube will begin removing misleading videos about abortion in response to falsehoods being spread about the procedure that is being banned or restricted across a broad swath of the U.S. The move announced Thursday by the Googleowned video site comes about a month after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the case that had protected the legality of abortion in the country for nearly 50 years. YouTube said its crackdown will expunge content promoting unsafe athome abortions, as well as misinformation about the safety of undergoing the procedure in clinics located in states where it remains legal. A federal lawsuit filed Thursday alleges Chicago police misused unreliable gunshot detection technology in investigating a grandfather from the citys South Side who was charged with killing a neighbor. The lawsuit filed by the MacArthur Justice Center at Northwestern Universitys law school seeks damages from the city on behalf of 65yearold Michael Williams, who says he still suffers from a tremor in his hand that developed while he was locked up in jail for nearly a year. The Associated Press reported last year that a judge dismissed his case at the request of prosecutors, who said they had insufficient evidence. A former Coinbase employee and his brother, along with a Houston man, have been charged in what federal authorities described as the U.S. governments first cryptocurrency insider trading case. Ishan Wahi and Nikhil Wahi have been arrested while Sameer Ramani remains at large. Federal authorities announced the unsealing of an indictment Thursday in federal court in Manhattan. They said 32yearold Ishan Wahi was a product manager at Coinbase when he provided tips to 26yearold Nikhil Wahi and their 33yearold friend Ramani. All were charged with wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud. Attorneys representing Ishan Wahi say he is innocent. Messages seeking comment were sent to other lawyers. Cybersecurity researchers say a popular Chinesemade automotive GPS tracker used in 169 countries has severe software vulnerabilities. Because it is used by law enforcement, militaries and Fortune 50 companies it could potentially pose a danger to life and limb, national security and supply chains. A report by the Boston cybersecurity firm BitSight says attackers could remotely hijack deviceequipped vehicles by cutting off fuel and otherwise wresting control of them. It recommends users immediately disable the MV720 GPS tracker until a fix becomes available. The U.S. Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency planned to issue an advisory Tuesday about the tracker after unsuccessful attempts to get the manufacturer to produce a fix. The economy is a bit wobbly, but General Motors CEO Mary Barra isnt backing off of an audacious prediction: She pledges that by the middle of this decade, her company will sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla, the global sales leader. She faces some long odds against immense economic forces that are working against auto sales. But in an interview with The Associated Press, Barra says GM can win by rolling out more affordable EVs, as well as pickup trucks and luxury vehicles. Her challenge is huge. Last year GM sold just 25,000 electric vehicles in the U.S., compared with an estimated 352,000 sold by Tesla.

{"id":159,"cleaned text":"Artificial intelligence presents a moral dilemma Demonstrators turned on the flash of their smartphones on Bastille Square to defend the freedom values of France this Saturday, November 28, 2020, as several tens of thousands of people participated in the great March of Liberties in Paris to protest against the Global Security Bill which aims to prohibit the dissemination of images of police officers in France and the widespread use of surveillance methods such as drones and facial recognition. While the demonstration was peaceful and full of signs and opposition slogans, at the end of the demonstration many clashes broke out between Black Blocks and Police officers on the Place de la Bastille. Photo by Samuel BoivinNurPhoto via Getty Images Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the world has grown increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence AI technologies. Thousands of new innovations  from contacttracing apps to the drones delivering medical equipment  sprang up to help us meet the challenges of Covid19 and life under lockdown. The unprecedented speed with which a vaccine for Covid19 was discovered can partly be attributed to the use of AI algorithms which rapidly crunched the data from thousands of clinical trials, allowing researchers around the world to compare notes in real time. As Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft observed, in just two months, the world witnessed a rate of digital transition wed usually only see in two years. In 2017, PWC published a study showing that adoption of AI technologies could increase global GDP by 14 by 2030. In addition to creating jobs and boosting economies, AI technologies have the potential to drive sustainable development and even out inequalities, democratising access to healthcare and education, mitigating the effects of climate change and making food production and distribution more efficient. But, unfortunately, the potential of AI for good is not currently being realised. As research published by the International Monetary Fund last year shows, today, AI technologies are more likely to exacerbate existing global inequalities than to address them. Or, in the words of the speculative fiction writer, William Gibson: The future is here, its just unevenly distributed. I am a professor of philosophy of science and the leader of a group concentrating on ethics at the Centre for AI Research. I focus on ensuring that these technologies are developed in a humancentered way for the benefit of all. In order to achieve this, we need equal education, actionable regulation, and true inclusion. These objectives are very far from being met on a global scale, and certainly are not met everywhere in Africa. This presents a serious moral dilemma to a country such as South Africa. Do we throw all caution to the wind and focus exclusively on becoming a global player in AI technology advancement as fast as possible, or do we pause and consider what measures are needed to ensure our actions will not sacrifice or imperil already vulnerable sectors of our society The scramble to develop technologies in the hubs of San Francisco, Austin, London and Beijing took place in a more or less unregulated Wild West until very recently. Now, the world is waking up. In June 2020, United Nations secretary general Antnio Guterres laid out a roadmap for digital cooperation, acknowledging that the responsibility for reaching a global agreement on the ethical development of AI rested on the shoulders of the UNs Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation Unesco. Unesco is working to build a global consensus on how governments can harness AI to benefit everyone. A diverse group of 24 specialists from six regions of the world met in 2020 and collaborated to produce a Global Recommendation on the Ethics of AI. If adopted by Unescos 193 member states, this agreement on technology development will be groundbreaking: instead of competing with one another to corner the market on bigger and faster technology, countries all over the world will be united by a new common vision to develop humancentred, ethical artificial intelligence. One of the biggest obstacles to realising the hope of AI for social good, however, is the silencing of some voices in a debate that should be a universal one. Africas best and brightest have been excluded from contributing to the conversation in many ways, ranging from difficulties in accessing visas to not being included in international networks. There is serious and important work being done on the subject in Africa  Data Science Africa and the Deep Learning Indaba, to name two examples. This work is often overlooked by the international community whereas, in fact, the opportunity the world has to learn from research in Africa should be grabbed. As Moustapha Cisse, director of Google Ghana says: Being in an environment where the challenges are unique in many ways gives us an opportunity to explore problems that maybe other researchers in other places would not be able to explore. In addition, in December last year, following a highprofile parting of ways with Google, Timnit Gebru, the highly regarded ethics researcher, expressed deep concern about the possibility of racial discrimination being amplified by AI technologies: Unless there is some sort of shift of power, where people who are most affected by these technologies are allowed to shape them as well and be able to imagine what these technologies should look like from the ground up and build them according to that, unless we move towards that kind of future, I am really worried that these tools are going to be used more for harm than good. Gebrus fears are born out by a plethora of examples from racist facial recognition technology to racist predictive policing tools and financial risk analysis. Gebru makes the call that technical communities should be challenged to be more diverse and inclusive, because inherent structural bias in training data would then have a bigger chance of being picked up. It is also becoming very clear that every person has a role in ensuring that innovation in the field upholds human rights, such as the right to privacy, or the right not to be racially discriminated against. Every person should have access to education, should be sensitised to the ethics of AI and be information literate every person should have access to positions in tech companies and be able to participate in technological invention, and every person should be protected against possible harm from technologies in an effective and actionable way. Furthermore, regulations need to be actionable, legally enforceable and as dynamic as the ethics underpinning them. First, we must guard against lofty ideals that are alien to the world of mathematics and algorithms that computer engineers inhabit. Its key we acknowledge the active multi and interdisciplinary nature of the discipline of AI in its full extension in our classrooms, places of work, and governmental settings. Second, regulation should be armed with legal force. It is too easy to shirk regulations by citing inhouse policies, or shifting some development to countries with weaker legislation in some areas. Third, AI ethics regulation should be supple enough to absorb future technological advances as well as changes in the AI readiness status of different countries which ranges along a continuum of scientific, technological, educational, societal, cultural, infrastructure, economic, legal, regulatory dimensions. Since any new AI application can be bought or sold anywhere in the world, and since ethics dumping  a term coined by the wellknown ethics of information expert, Luciano Floridi, referring to big companies simply taking their business where regulation is weaker  is a real thing in Africa, the new rule book on how AI technologies are developed, must be a global rule book. As Teki Akuetteh Falconer, Ghanaian lawyer and executive director of Africa Digital Rights Hub said: Im a data protection regulator but unable to call big tech companies to order because theyre not even registered in my country If Unescos member states adopt the ethics recommendations, it could pave the way for realising the potential of AI technologies that benefit us all. These are unprecedented times, and the role of media to tell and record the story of South Africa as it develops is more important than ever.

First reported by The Wall Street Journal, according to a state filing, Musk is the only listed director of the company and director of Musks family office Jared Birchall is listed as the companys secretary. Musk has previously stated his intention to create X, the everything app. The new companys name  X.AI, sounds like it might be affiliated with Musks Everything app. Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app Its worth noting that Musk recently also changed Twitters name to X Corp., matching the name of his new company. According to a legal filing from last week, Twitter is also now incorporated in Nevada instead of its previous home in Delaware. The Wall Street Journal says that Nevadas laws provide more discretion and protection to a companys management and officers than Delaware, which is likely why Musk changed the social media companys registration. The new companys name suggests it will likely deal in AI research. This comes soon after Musk cosigned an open letter addressed to AI labs globally to pause the development of largescale AI systems, quoting concerns regarding profound risks to society and humanity. Soon after, it was reported that Musk was working on an AI project within Twitter. The company even acquired roughly 10,000 GPUs graphics processing units, likely to be used on a large AI model for the platform. According to sources familiar with the matter, the project is at an early stage. Its currently unclear what Musks AI project would focus on. Likely use cases could be to better target users with ads or improve the platforms search functionality. Further, according to Business Insider, Musk hired Igor Babuschkin and Manuel Kroiss from Alphabetowned AI research firm DeepMind in March to help him on his AI endeavour that would rival OpenAIs ChatGPT.

It can be recalled that the company confirmed its plan to do it to 10,000 of its total workforce population this 2023. The continuation of this plan occurred last week, leaving 10 of Microsofts GitHub workforce axed from their positions. With about 3,000 employees, this translates to at least 300 individuals. To further save, Microsoft also decided to continue the hiring freeze in GitHub and make the workforce fully remote. Aside from this recent layoff, Microsoft also killed its Industrial Metaverse Core team it created four months ago. This resulted in the layoff of at least 100 individuals, The Information reported.Microsofts strong faith in AIAs the software titan continues its AI efforts to boost its services and products, its leaders express their confidence in the path the company is pursuing. In a recent interview, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella taunted Google.At the end of the day, Google is the 800pound gorilla in this, Nadella told The Verge. I hope that, with our innovation, they will definitely want to come out and show that they can dance. And I want people to know that we made them dance.Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates also expressed his confidence in ChatGPT, saying it is a significant invention that can change the world.Until now, artificial intelligence could read and write, but could not understand the content. The new programs like ChatGPT will make many office jobs more efficient by helping to write invoices or letters. This will change our world, Gates told German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview.More AI in Microsoft services and products After unveiling the ChatGPTpowered Bing and revamped Edge, Microsoft is now planning to inject AI tech into its Office products. In March, the company has tentative plans to have an announcement highlighting how quickly Microsoft wants to reinvent search and its productivity apps through its OpenAI investments and detailing its productivity plans related to the said matter.This should not be surprising, though, as it has been known by many for weeks now. Also, the software giant has recently integrated AI features into some of its services, including Viva Sales and Teams Premium.In the future, Microsoft plans to allow companies, schools, and governments to release their own chatbots using ChatGPT technology. According to CNBC, the chatbot creators will be allowed to remove the branding of Microsoft and OpenAI once they release their own versions developed with the software.Edge and Bing are improvingThanks to their new AI capabilities, Bing and Edge have seen great improvements recently. According to Microsoft, more than 1 million people joined the waitlist in 48 hours to try the new Bing. Also, Bing and Edge received a huge leap in app ranking, ranking the former at 10th place in the free download category and the latter at third place in the utility app section last week in the US Apple App Store.Edge is also getting Adobe Acrobat PDF support starting in March, announced by Microsoft last week. It will replace the current Microsoft Edge PDF solution using the legacy engine, which will be removed in March 2024. In other news, Edge has a new rival in Opera after announcing that it is now integrating ChatGPT into its browsers. The feature Shorten can summarize articles and webpages in bullet forms and will be shown in a sidebar almost similar to Edges sidebar feature. Google is also on the move now after showcasing the Bard AI tool, though the result was not that pleasing for the company. Days ago, Google shared a demo of the tool. However, the Bard demo included an error, causing the companys shares to drop 100 billion.Windows legacy inbox Troubleshooters RetirementMicrosoft is removing its MSDT platform in 2025. The retirement of Windows legacy inbox Troubleshooters includes the Keyboard troubleshooter and Speech troubleshooter, and the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool MSDT that runs them, according to Microsoft.The builtin tools can automatically diagnose and fix common problems in some Windows features. However, in the next Windows 11 release, the troubleshooters MSDT is running will be killed by Microsoft. Microsoft shared the timeline for this plan: 2023  Begin redirecting some of the troubleshooters to the new Get Help troubleshooting platform 2024  Complete the troubleshooter redirection and remove the rest of the troubleshooters 2025  Remove the MSDT platformMore features are being tested for WindowsAs usual, Microsoft continues to test different features it wants to include in its Windows system in the future. Some features unveiled in the past weeks include the new copy button for quickly copying twofactor authentication 2FA codes in notification toasts and RGB lighting controls in the Dev Build 25295. A new leak also indicates that Microsoft is preparing the Windows 11 Moment 4 update, though we are still waiting for Moment 2 to arrive.Meanwhile, Microsoft is testing a new Sent pages feature in Edge that will allow users to view the tabs sent to their other devices. There is also a new update for Windows Subsystem for Android on Windows 11, giving it a handful of improvements for camera experience, graphics improvements, general reliability, and security updates.The battle to win the Activision megadeal continues Microsofts struggles to win the Activision merger deal are still present, especially now with Britains Competition and Markets Authority CMA repeating its concerns in its recently published provisional findings. Additionally, the watchdog says it prefers structural remedies over behavioral remedies and even suggests the divestiture or selloff of some of Activions segments, including the business associated with Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, among other titles.Activisions EVP, Lulu Cheng Meservey, responded to CMAs findings by pointing out that the regulator has greatly focused on Sony.The CMA is concerned the deal could impact rival console gaming platforms, said Meservey. But its really just about one platform: Sony. Nowhere does CMA even mention Nintendo, which has already accepted Microsofts offer to guarantee COD access for 10 yrs bringing games to MORE consoles.In related news, Sony described the subpoena served by Microsoft as truly massive and its demands obvious harassment. The statement surfaced in the recent documents filed by Sony in FTCs inhouse court for FTCs Activision merger case. Microsoft wanted Sony to divulge some details of its business as part of its discovery procedure to build its defense in the case. The rival, however, refused to produce them, according to Microsoft.Teams has a new free version with a caveatMicrosoft is replacing the current Microsoft Teams Free classic with the new Microsoft Teams free version. Aside from this troubling name change, the bigger problem is that current users of the former will be forced to get the Teams Essentials subscription to maintain access to your data. Indeed, there will be no option to automatically do it, which will be problematic for businesses with huge amounts of data in the current free Teams version.Designed specifically with small and mediumsized businesses in mind, Teams Essentials is the newest version of Teams, which you can purchase separately from Microsoft 365 offerings, Microsoft says on its FAQ. After April 12, 2023, Microsoft will no longer support Teams Free classic.

{"id":175,"cleaned text":"Price less important as dataled AI set to transform CX in 2022 Posted by Dave Stopher  Dec 28, 2021  Business, Technology  0  The world experienced a decade of technological acceleration in a matter of days due to the challenges of lockdown, and this trend is set to continue, according to a new study. Today, customer review experts Feefo released its annual CX trends report which highlights how the improved service offered to customers through greater access to data, information and competitor brands online means pricing has less of an impact on purchasing decisions than before. In fact, 86 of online shoppers are willing to pay more for a great customer experience CX from a brand. Data shows that good CX can lead to a 300 boost in annual recurring revenue ARR over three years for businesses that deliver consistently good experiences. The report suggests that brands should no longer look to compete on price instead, companies should invest in technology to improve CX and meet everevolving customer expectations. Feefos report features CX predictions by leading customer experience experts from across a broad range of companies, including Campaign Monitor, Mitel and Twilio. Big strides in dataled AI and chatbot functionality: automated payments, multilingual expansions and further complexity. A shift that prioritises employee experience EX as part of the overall CX package, in light of The Great Resignation which saw a mass movement of staff during the lockdown. Predictive customer insights becoming commonplace for businesses of all sizes, to bring hyperpersonalised and relevant interactions at all stages of the customer journey. James Shanahan, CMO of Feefo, says: Data plays a crucial part in reviews and customer experience platforms. I would encourage every brand to start thinking about how to leverage data that their clients are or could be sharing with them. A number of the CX experts in the report suggested that dataled AI and hyperpersonalised experiences will be key to success in 2022 and beyond. Richard Roberts, Vice President, UK  I and Northern Europe at business collaborations solutions provider, Mitel, said: AI is making communications more efficient, for example, through the use of chatbots to handle routine requests and provide customers with information faster, and even offhours. AI can also help with more complex tasks  agentassist apps can be used to analyse the sentiment of customer queries or provide the agent with realtime research and coaching. Shanahan goes on to say: Feefo predicts that brands will further leverage data analytics and lean on AI, enabling potential customers to filter those reviews of more likeminded people first, beyond the usual filters of, say, age, sex and relationship status. Its also possible that reviews could supersede product descriptions over time.

{"id":177,"cleaned text":"How artificial intelligence is matching drugs to patientsRead full article1Natalie Lisbona  Business reporter, Tel AvivApril 16, 2023, 7:07 PM4 min readDr Talia Cohen Solal, left, is using AI to help her and her team find the best antidepressants for patientsDr Talia Cohen Solal sits down at a microscope to look closely at human brain cells grown in a petri dish.The brain is very subtle, complex and beautiful, she says.A neuroscientist, Dr Cohen Solal is the cofounder and chief executive of Israeli healthtech firm Genetika.Established in 2018, the company says its technology can best match antidepressants to patients, to avoid unwanted side effects, and make sure that the prescribed drug works as well as possible.We can characterise the right medication for each patient the first time, adds Dr Cohen Solal.Genetika does this by combining the latest in stem cell technology  the growing of specific human cells  with artificial intelligence AI software.From a patients blood sample its technicians can generate brain cells. These are then exposed to several antidepressants, and recorded for cellular changes called biomarkers.This information, taken with a patients medical history and genetic data, is then processed by an AI system to determine the best drug for a doctor to prescribe and the dosage.Although the technology is currently still in the development stage, Tel Avivbased Genetika intends to launch commercially next year.The global pharmaceutical sector had revenues of 1.4 trillion in 2021An example of how AI is increasingly being used in the pharmaceutical sector, the company has secured funding from the European Unions European Research Council and European Innovation Council. Genetika is also working with pharmaceutical firms to develop new precision drugs.The company hopes its work will be in strong demand in the future. There are more than 280 million people globally who suffer from depression, according to the World Health Organization. And while taking antidepressants certainly wont be the correct treatment for all, it has long been estimated that almost two thirds of initial prescriptions for depression or anxiety may not work properly.We are in the right time to be able to marry the latest computer technology and biological technology advances, says Dr Cohen Solal.Story continuesDr Heba Sailem says that the potential for AI to transform the global pharmaceutical industry, which generated revenues of 1.4 trillion 1.1tn in 2021, is huge.A senior lecturer of biomedical AI and data science at Kings College London, she says that AI has so far helped with everything from identifying a potential target gene for treating a certain disease, and discovering a new drug, to improving patient treatment by predicting the best treatment strategy, discovering biomarkers for personalised patient treatment, or even prevention of the disease through early detection of signs for its occurrence.New Tech EconomyNew Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Yet fellow AI expert Calum Chace says that the takeup of AI across the pharmaceutical sector remains a slow process.Pharma companies are huge, and any significant change in the way they do research and development will affect many people in different divisions, says Mr Chace, who is the author of a number of books about AI.Getting all these people to agree to a dramatically new way of doing things is hard, partly because senior people got to where they are by doing things the old way.They are familiar with that, and they trust it. And they may fear becoming less valuable to the firm if what they know how to do suddenly becomes less valued.However, Dr Sailem emphasises that the pharmaceutical sector shouldnt be tempted to race ahead with AI, and should employ strict measures before relying on its predictions.An AI model can learn the right answer for the wrong reasons, and it is the researchers and developers responsibility to ensure that various measures are employed to avoid biases, especially when trained on patients data, she says.Hong Kongbased Insilico Medicine is using AI to accelerate drug discovery.Our AI platform is capable of identifying existing drugs that can be repurposed, designing new drugs for known disease targets, or finding brand new targets and designing brand new molecules, says cofounder and chief executive Alex Zhavoronkov.Alex Zhavoronkov says that using AI is helping his firm to develop new drugs more quickly than would otherwise be the caseIts most developed drug, a treatment for a lung condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is now being clinically trialled.Mr Zhavoronkov says it typically takes four years for a new drug to get to that stage, but that thanks to AI, Insilico Medicine achieved it in under 18 months, for a fraction of the cost.He adds that the firm has another 31 drugs in various stages of development.Back in Israel, Dr Cohen Solal says AI can help solve the mystery of which drugs work.

{"id":179,"cleaned text":"AI for Africa, by Africa: A Call to Action for Inclusive and Ethical Artificial Intelligence Policies 1 From South Juba to Entebbe, from Marrakesh to Accra, on the cusp of technology in Africa, the need for responsible AI development and ethical data practices has never been more pressing. As technology continues to advance and shape the global economy, Africa is taking steps toward positioning itself as a leader in Artificial Intelligence AI.  Investments and innovations in AI are on the rise across the continent, with a growing number of countries beginning to develop policies and strategies to harness the power of this transformative technology. Although only a few countries have officially adopted AI strategies and policies, many more are actively working towards defining their AI policies. As philosopher and economist Amartya Sen noted, Development requires the removal of major sources of unfreedom that leave people with little choice and little opportunity of exercising their reasoned agency. By creating policies and fostering innovation in AI, African countries can empower their citizens to take advantage of the opportunities presented by this innovative technology and make meaningful contributions to their communities and the world at large. Current state and trend of AI policy framework on the continent Africa has been slower to adopt artificial intelligence AI technologies compared to other regions of the world because of a range of factors, such as infrastructure challenges and limited financial resources. According to the Global AI Index, African countries are generally classified as nascent or waking up in terms of AI investment, innovation, and implementation, with countries like Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya being nascent and Morocco, South Africa, and Tunisia as waking up. Notwithstanding the challenges, the AI industry is rapidly expanding on the continent, with over 2,400 companies specializing in AI, 41 of which are startups. These companies are poised to tap into the immense potential of AI to transform industries, create jobs, and drive economic development.  As a renowned computer scientist, Alan Turing, aptly puts We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done. This statement underscores the potential economic impact of AI. Experts suggest that the technology could contribute up to US1.5 billion to the continents GDP by 2030. A recent study conducted by McKinsey, a leading global consultancy firm, found that, by analyzing approximately 160 cases of AIs social impact, they could identify ten areas where incorporating AI into solutions could cause a significant positive impact on society. These areas align with all 17 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and have the potential to positively affect millions of people globally. A few African countries have taken the steps to develop policies, strategies specifically focused on advancing the use of AI in their countries. Three notable examples include Mauritius, Egypt, and Kenya. Mauritius AI strategy was published in 2018. This policy document recognized the potential of AI and other emerging technologies to address a range of social and economic issues and as a key driver of economic growth. The strategy lays out areas of focus, such as manufacturing, healthcare, FinTech, agriculture, smart ports and maritime traffic management. Kenya, in 2018, created the Distributed Ledgers Technology and AI Task Force to develop a roadmap of how the country can fully leverage these technologies. The task forces report published in 2019 notes that AI and other frontier technologies can increase national competitiveness and accelerate innovation, positioning Kenya as a regional and international leader in information and communication technology. The report recommends investments in infrastructure and skills development, as well as the development of effective regulations to balance citizen protection and private sector innovation. Egypt, in 2021, introduced a national AI strategy with a twofold vision of utilizing AI to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and positioning Egypt as a key regional and international player in AI. The strategy is built on four pillars: AI for government, AI for development, capacity building, and international activities. The country aims to foster cooperation on AI through active participation in relevant international initiatives and forums, launching regional initiatives, promoting AI for development as a priority, and initiating projects with partner countries. Besides the African countries that have already developed AI strategies, there are many more that are taking steps toward defining AI policies. Ethiopia, Ghana, Morocco, Rwanda, South Africa, Tunisia, and Uganda are all exploring ways to harness the potential of AI to drive economic growth and development. For example, Ghana and Uganda participated in the Ethical Policy Frameworks for Artificial Intelligence in the Global South, a 2019 pilot project led by UN Global Pulse and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, which aimed to support the development of local policy frameworks for AI.  Ghana continues to work with UN Global Pulse to map its AI ecosystem and develop a blueprint for its national AI strategy. Similarly, Rwanda is working to develop a national AI policy that focuses on the ethical use of AI to support social and economic development. Ethiopia has established the Ethiopian Artificial Intelligence Institute, which is tasked with formulating national policies, legislation, and regulatory frameworks related to AI. Several prominent technology companies have been increasing their presence in the African AI market in recent years. For instance, IBM has established research facilities in Kenya and South Africa, and Google has set up similar centers in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. Google has a dedicated African AI research center in Ghana that was opened in 2018, and in 2022, the company announced a product development center in Kenya.  To add, in February 2023, AIDEC Consultancies International Ltd AIDEC Digital, and its Consortium Partners, launched an AI Centre of Excellence with colocation at Academic City University College, Accra, Ghana. The two AI Centers of Excellence results from a Consortium Partnership between them, the Institute of ICT Professionals IIPGH, Ghana, and their International Partners, 7W Artificial Intelligence company Ltd of Slovenia. The Centre will provide both inperson and virtual training, educational programs, and consulting services to organizations, Institutions in the private, public, and third sectors, giving practical knowledge in areas of AI and its application for Agriculture, Health, Education, FinTech, Mechanical Engineering, etc. These multinational and local companies are helping to drive innovation and investment in the African AI ecosystem, and their presence will have a significant impact on the growth and development of the sector.

{"id":181,"cleaned text":"3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks With Explosive Upside Potential  This years economic slowdown dealt a blow to technology investors, who are contending with rivers of red ink in their portfolios. The techheavy Nasdaq100 stock market index has declined by 29 in 2022 so far, but a cohort of stocks in the artificial intelligence AI sector have fared significantly worse. Shares of Upstart Holdings UPST 1.52, C3.ai AI 1.29, and Lemonade LMND 2.35 each lost more than 80 of their value from their alltime high stock prices, but that might not be a fair representation of their underlying businesses, which are still growing and improving. There have been some early signs that inflation peaked back in June, which could result in far more favorable economic conditions in 2023. That might reignite investors appetite for highgrowth technology stocks, making the abovementioned names look like bargains at current levels. Upstart is on a mission to transform the lending industry by using AI to analyze up to 1,600 data points on potential borrowers and coming to an instant decision about their creditworthiness. Traditionally, banks rely on Fair Isaacs narrower FICO credit scoring system, which Upstart says hasnt kept pace with the modern economic and employment landscape. Plus, current methods of assessment can take days or weeks to deliver a decision. Upstart doesnt lend any money itself, but rather gets paid by its bank partners to originate loans. The company has suffered a twopronged challenge this year amid the slowing economy: Its funding partners have a lesser appetite to purchase these loans, and with interest rates on the rise, consumers simply arent seeking as much credit. As a result, Upstarts projected annual revenue growth for 2022 is set to grind to a halt. After soaring by 264 to 849 million in 2021 compared to 2020, its expected to fall slightly this year to 830 million. But there are some positive signs beneath the surface. The number of banks and credit unions signing on to use Upstarts AIdriven approach soared by 167 in the recent third quarter ended Sept. 30. Plus, the number of car dealers adopting its Upstart Auto Retail sales and loan origination software jumped 141, with 37 of the worlds top automotive brands now on the platform.  It hints that the recent slowdown in the companys revenue growth might only be temporary, and if the economy does pick up steam in 2023, Upstart could experience a resurgence. Given its stock trades at a rockbottom pricetosales PS ratio of just 1.7, investors who take the leap at current levels could be handsomely rewarded. What do Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet have in common All three partnered with enterprise artificial intelligence pioneer C3.ai to boost their respective cloud services platforms. C3.ai has effectively created a brandnew industry, where it helps businesses across at least nine different sectors gain access to AI technology. It provides readymade and customizable applications for a range of different purposes. The oil and gas industry, for example, uses C3.ai to monitor critical equipment to predict failures, which helps to prevent environmental disasters. It also uses the technology to boost efficiency and produce cleaner fossil fuels. The major cloud players named above use C3.ai to increase their customers productivity. On Amazon Web Services, an AI application can be developed up to 26 times faster than if C3.ai wasnt integrated into the platform. As a result, these tech giants sell some of their cloud services with C3.ai jointly. C3.ai is in the middle of a major transition to the way it charges its customers. It has always sold its services under subscription agreements, which are predictable, but which have a long sales cycle because of the time it takes to negotiate pricing. Its now moving to a consumptionbased model, which will result in a slowdown in revenue growth initially but could deliver accelerated gains over the long run. This will also allow C3.ai to onboard new customers far more quickly, which could in turn boost sales growth even further. For context, the company expects its annual revenue growth to come in flat by the close of fiscal 2023 ending Jan. 31, but the new consumptionbased model could supercharge it to a 30 increase next year. C3.ai stock is down over 90 from its alltime high, and the company now trades at a valuation of just 1.5 billion. But excluding its 840 million in cash, investors value the business at under 700 million, or a minuscule PS ratio of less than 3. The company, however, believes its addressable opportunity could be worth 596 billion by 2025. Traditional insurers have a reputation for relatively slow and onerous claims processes, but what if, through the power of AI technology, you could lodge a claim and be automatically paid out in under three minutes Thats the customer experience Lemonade aims to deliver across its homeowners, renters, life, pet, and car insurance products.  AI powers most aspects of its business, including the way it prices premiums. Earlier this year, the company unleashed its most predictive AI model yet, called Lifetime Value 6 LTV6. It attempts to determine the lifetime value of a customer based on their likelihood of switching insurers, the probability of them purchasing multiple policies, and the odds of them making a claim. From there, Lemonade calculates an appropriate premium. But LTV6 dives even deeper into Lemonades business, identifying underperforming geographic markets and products to allow the company to rapidly pivot to optimize its financial performance. Overall, Lemonade has attracted more than 1.77 million customers. Its average premium per customer soared 35 in the recent third quarter to 343, which was an alltime high. Additionally, and with the help of its recent acquisition of MetroMile, Lemonades inforce premium jumped 76 to 609 million. Inforce premium is the metric by which most insurers measure success, as it represents the value of premiums paid for active policies. Lemonade has focused on investing in growth, and its clearly working, but it has come at the expense of profitability. Its attempting to swing its bottomline into the black and believes it can do so with the cash it has on hand without requiring any fresh capital. With Lemonade stock down 89 from its alltime high, investors who buy now might benefit over the long term if the company does successfully reach that profitability milestone.
